@article{Rapisarda2004Topoisomerase-I,
	Abstract = {We have shown previously that the camptothecin analogue topotecan (TPT), a topoisomerase I (Top 1) poison, inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcriptional activity and HIF-1α protein accumulation in hypoxia-treated U251 human glioma cells. In this article, we demonstrate that TPT does not affect HIF-1α protein half-life or mRNA accumulation but inhibits its translation. In addition, we demonstrate that Top 1 is required for the inhibition of HIF-1α protein accumulation by TPT as shown by experiments performed using camptothecin-resistant cell lines with known Top 1 alterations. Experiments performed with aphidicolin indicated that TPT inhibited HIF-1 protein accumulation in the absence of DNA replication. DNA-damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and doxorubicin, did not affect HIF-1α protein accumulation. Ongoing transcription was essential for the inhibition of HIF-1α protein accumulation by TPT. Our results demonstrate the existence of a novel pathway connecting Top 1-dependent signaling events and the regulation of HIF-1α protein expression and function. In addition, our findings dissociate the cytotoxic activity of TPT from the inhibition of the HIF-1 pathway and raise the possibility of novel clinical applications of TPT aimed at targeting HIF-1-dependent responses. {\textcopyright}2004 American Association for Cancer Research.},

@article{Sherratt2009Tissue-elastici,
	Abstract = {The ability of elastic tissues to deform under physiological forces and to subsequently release stored energy to drive passive recoil is vital to the function of many dynamic tissues. Within vertebrates, elastic fibres allow arteries and lungs to expand and contract, thus controlling variations in blood pressure and returning the pulmonary system to a resting state. Elastic fibres are composite structures composed of a cross-linked elastin core and an outer layer of fibrillin microfibrils. These two components perform distinct roles; elastin stores energy and drives passive recoil, whilst fibrillin microfibrils direct elastogenesis, mediate cell signalling, maintain tissue homeostasis via TGFβsequestration and potentially act to reinforce the elastic fibre. In many tissues reduced elasticity, as a result of compromised elastic fibre function, becomes increasingly prevalent with age and contributes significantly to the burden of human morbidity and mortality. This review considers how the unique molecular structure, tissue distribution and longevity of elastic fibres pre-disposes these abundant extracellular matrix structures to the accumulation of damage in ageing dermal, pulmonary and vascular tissues. As compromised elasticity is a common feature of ageing dynamic tissues, the development of strategies to prevent, limit or reverse this loss of function will play a key role in reducing age-related morbidity and mortality.},

@article{Berend1984Protective-Effe,
	Abstract = { The effect of hypoxia on the development of bleomycin lung toxicity was studied in 26 rats. Thirteen rats received an endotracheal injection of saline, and 13 rats received a similar injection of 1.5 units of bleomycin in saline. Six saline-treated and 6 bleomycin-treated rats were exposed to 10\% oxygen for 2 days prior and 2 days subsequent to the injections, and then breathed air for a further 5 days before being killed. The other rats breathed air continuously, and were also killed 7 days after the injections. Although all bleomycin-treated animals had some evidence of lung toxicity, histologic examination of the lungs revealed markedly reduced bleomycin toxicity in the rats exposed to hypoxia. This was confirmed by morphometry, which demonstrated that the volume density of alveolar walls (mean $\pm$ SEM) was significantly lower in the bleomycin-hypoxia group (11.8 $\pm$ 0.8\%) than in the bleomycin-air group (18.8 $\pm$ 1.1\%) (p < 0.001). It is concluded that hypoxia offers protection against bleomycin lung toxicity in the rat. },

@article{Badylak2008Macrophage-Phen,
	Abstract = { Abstract Macrophage phenotype can be characterized as proinflammatory (M1) or immunomodulatory and tissue remodeling (M2). The present study used a rat model to determine the macrophage phenotype at the site of implantation of two biologic scaffolds that were derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and that differed mainly according to their method of processing: the Restore device (SIS) and the CuffPatch device (carbodiimide crosslinked form of porcine-derived SIS (CDI-SIS)). An autologous tissue graft was used as a control implant. Immunohistologic methods were used to identify macrophage surface markers CD68 (pan macrophages), CD80 and CCR7 (M1 profile), and CD163 (M2 profile) during the remodeling process. All graft sites were characterized by the dense population of CD68+ mononuclear cells present during the first 4 weeks. The SIS device elicited a predominantly CD163+ response (M2 profile, p < 0.001) and showed constructive remodeling at 16 weeks. The CDI-SIS device showed a predominately CD80+ and CCR7+ response (M1 profile, p < 0.03), and at 16 weeks was characterized by chronic inflammation. The autologous tissue graft showed a predominately CD163+ response (M2) at 1 week, with a dual M1/M2 population (CD80+, CCR7+, and CD163+) by 2 and 4 weeks and moderately well organized connective tissue by 16 weeks. The processing methods used during the manufacturing of a biologic scaffold can have a profound influence upon the macrophage phenotype profile and downstream remodeling events. Routine histologic examination alone is inadequate to determine the phenotype of mononuclear cells that participate in the host response to the scaffold. },

@article{Pouliot2017Development-and,
	Abstract = {The complexity and rapid clearance mechanisms of lung tissue make it difficult to develop effective treatments for many chronic pathologies. We are investigating lung derived extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels as a novel approach for delivery of cellular therapies to the pulmonary system. The main objectives of this study include effective decellularization of porcine lung tissue, development of a hydrogel from the porcine ECM, and characterization of the material's composition, mechanical properties, and ability to support cellular growth. Our evaluation of the decellularized tissue indicated successful removal of cellular material and immunogenic remnants in the ECM. The self-assembly of the lung ECM hydrogel was rapid, reaching maximum modulus values within 3 min at 37$\,^{\circ}$C. Rheological characterization showed the lung ECM hydrogel to have a concentration dependent storage modulus between 15 and 60 Pa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our novel ECM derived hydrogel and measure its ability to support 3D culture of MSCs in vitro and in vivo delivery of MSCs. Our in vitro experiments using human mesenchymal stem cells demonstrated our novel ECM hydrogel's ability to enhance cellular attachment and viability. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that rat MSC delivery in pre-gel solution significantly increased cell retention in the lung over 24 h in an emphysema rat model. {\copyright}2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

So far successful clinical translation has been limited to hollow organs in which rudimental vascularization can be achieved by inserting the graft into flaps of the omentum or muscle fascia. This technique used to stimulate vascularization of the graft takes advantage of angiogenesis from existing vascular networks. Vascularization of the engineered graft is a fundamental requirement in the process of engineering more complex organs, as it is crucial for the efficient delivery of nutrients and oxygen following in-vivo implantation. To achieve vascularization of the organ many different techniques have been investigated and exploited. The most promising results have been obtained by seeding endothelial cells directly into decellularized scaffolds, taking advantage of the channels remaining from the pre-existing vascular network. Currently, the main hurdle we need to overcome is achieving a fully functional vascular endothelium, stable over a long time period of time, which is engineered using a cell source that is clinically suitable and can generate, in vitro, a yield of cells suitable for the engineering of human sized organs. This review will give an overview of the approaches that have recently been investigated to address the issue of vascularization in the field of tissue engineering of whole organs, and will highlight the current caveats and hurdles that should be addressed in the future.},

@article{Sava2017Human-pericytes,
	Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease of unknown etiology characterized by a compositionally and mechanically altered extracellular matrix. Poor understanding of the origin of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expressing myofibroblasts has hindered curative therapies. Though proposed as a source of myofibroblasts in mammalian tissues, identification of microvascular pericytes (PC) as contributors to α-SMA--expressing populations in human IPF and the mechanisms driving this accumulation remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate enhanced detection of α-SMA+ cells coexpressing the PC marker neural/glial antigen 2 in the human IPF lung. Isolated human PC cultured on decellularized IPF lung matrices adopt expression of α-SMA, demonstrating that these cells undergo phenotypic transition in response to direct contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the fibrotic human lung. Using potentially novel human lung--conjugated hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties, we decoupled PC responses to matrix composition and stiffness to show that α-SMA+ PC accumulate in a mechanosensitive manner independent of matrix composition. PC activated with TGF-β1 remodel the normal lung matrix, increasing tissue stiffness to facilitate the emergence of α-SMA+ PC via MKL-1/MTRFA mechanotranduction. Nintedanib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor approved for IPF treatment, restores the elastic modulus of fibrotic lung matrices to reverse the α-SMA+ phenotype. This work furthers our understanding of the role that microvascular PC play in the evolution of IPF, describes the creation of an ex vivo platform that advances the study of fibrosis, and presents a potentially novel mode of action for a commonly used antifibrotic therapy that has great relevance for human disease.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Polyethylenimine (PEI), as a nonviral cationic polymer, has been widely used as gene delivery nanosystem. Although a number of investigations have highlighted its toxic impacts on target cells through induction of apoptosis/necrosis, still it is essential to look at its structural impacts on target cells. METHODS: In this current study, cytogenomic impacts of 25 kD linear and branched PEI (LPEI and BPEI, respectively) in A431 cells are reported to address possible mechanism for induction of apoptosis. At 40-50% confluency, A431 cells were exposed to PEI at a recommended concentration for 4 hr. After 24 hr, to detect apoptosis and DNA damage, the treated cells were subjected to MTT assay, FITC-labeled annexin V flow cytometry and comet assay. RESULTS: Flow cytometry assessments revealed that the BPEI can result in greater internalization than the linear PEI, which also induced greater cytotoxicity. Annexin V assay confirmed early and late apoptosis by BPEI, imposing somewhat DNA damage detected by comet assay. Western blot analysis resulted in induction of Akt-kinase which is possibly one of biomolecules affected by PEI. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that, despite induction of Akt-kinase, the BPEI can elicit apoptosis in target cells.},

A screening battery was established for assessment of a broad range of parameters related to adverse effects. Clear concentration response effects were observed related to impairment of mitochondrial function, membrane integrity and oxidative stress markers, but no effect was observed on genotoxicity. The adverse effects were highest for the liposomes. The High Content Screening seems optimal for initial screening of adverse effects, and combined with standard cytotoxicity measurements initial screening can be performed for predictive toxicological screening.},

@article{Khan2010Influence-of-ai,
	Abstract = {Understanding how tissue remodeling affects airway responsiveness is of key importance, but experimental data bearing on this issue remain scant. We used lung explants to investigate the effects of enzymatic digestion on the rate and magnitude of airway narrowing induced by acetylcholine. To link the observed changes in narrowing dynamics to the degree of alteration in tissue mechanics, we compared our experimental results with predictions made by a computational model of a dynamically contracting elastic airway embedded in elastic parenchyma. We found that treatment of explanted airways with two different proteases (elastase and collagenase) resulted in differential effects on the dynamics of airway narrowing following application of ACh. Histological corroboration of these different effects is manifest in different patterns of elimination of collagen and elastin from within the airway wall and the surrounding parenchyma. Simulations with a computational model of a dynamically contracting airway embedded in elastic parenchyma suggest that elastase exerts its functional effects predominately through a reduction in parenchymal tethering, while the effects of collagenase are more related to a reduction in airway wall stiffness. We conclude that airway and parenchymal remodeling as a result of protease activity can have varied effects on the loads opposing ASM shortening, with corresponding consequences for airway responsiveness.},

Objective: This review discusses the potential of mannose-targeted drug/antigen delivery systems for vaccination and treatment of diseases localized in macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells. Methods: The first part of the review describes the characteristics, localization and functions of mannose receptors. The following sections are devoted to the description of different methods used to deliver therapeutic agents, including mannose conjugates and mannosylated carriers or particulates (i.e., liposomes, nanoparticles and niosomes). Results/conclusions: A general overview of published reports confirms the effectiveness of mannosylation strategies, although the optimization and full exploitation of mannose-targeted drug delivery systems would require a deeper understanding of the structure?activity relationship. In the near future, these nanomedicines have the potential to treat a number of diseases (including cancer) and improve the quality of life of patients.},

Various carrier systems have emerged to deliver drugs to macrophages, albeit the efficacy, reliability and selectivity of these carriers are still in question. To date, the most extensively studied carriers are liposomes and microspheres. Various physicochemical properties of these carriers can alter their efficacy and specificity to a great extent. These properties include hydrophilicity, surface charge, composition, concentration, and presence of various ligands. In this review, a comprehensive evaluation of the literature has been carried out in order to show the role of these parameters in the design of carriers for targeting of drugs to macrophages.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, we have shown for the first time the effectiveness of a non-viral gene transfection strategy to re-polarize macrophages from M1 to M2 functional sub-type for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine encoding plasmid DNA was successfully encapsulated into non-condensing alginate based nanoparticles and the surface of the nano-carriers was modified with tuftsin peptide to achieve active macrophage targeting. Enhanced localization of tuftsin-modified alginate nanoparticles was observed in the inflamed paws of arthritic rats upon intraperitoneal administration. Importantly, targeted nanoparticle treatment was successful in reprogramming macrophage phenotype balance as ∼66% of total synovial macrophages from arthritic rats treated with the IL-10 plasmid DNA loaded tuftsin/alginate nanoparticles were in the M2 state compared to ∼9% of macrophages in the M2 state from untreated arthritic rats. Treatment significantly reduced systemic and joint tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) expression and prevented the progression of inflammation and joint damage as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Treatment enabled animals to retain their mobility throughout the course of study, whereas untreated animals suffered from impaired mobility. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeted alginate nanoparticles loaded with IL-10 plasmid DNA can efficiently re-polarize macrophages from an M1 to an M2 state, offering a novel treatment paradigm for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to modulate macrophage polarity from the pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype using plasmid DNA (pDNA) expressing interleukin-4 (IL4) or interleukin-10 (IL10)-encapsulated in hyaluronic acid-poly(ethyleneimine) (HA-PEI) nanoparticles (NPs). The HA-PEI/pDNA NPs with spherical shape, average size of 186 nm were efficiently internalized by J774A.1 macrophages. Transfection of HA-PEI/pDNA-IL4 and HA-PEI/pDNA-IL10 NPs increased IL4 and IL10 gene expression in J774 macrophages which could re-program the macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype as evidenced by a significant increase in the Arg/iNOS level, and upregulation of CD206 and CD163 compared to untreated macrophages. Following intraperitoneal (IP) injection to C57BL/6 mice, HA-PEI NPs effectively targeted peritoneal macrophages over-expressing CD44 receptor. In an in vivo model of stimulated peritoneal macrophages, IP administration of HA-PEI/pDNA-IL4 and HA-PEI/pDNA-IL10 to C57BL/6 mice significantly increased the Arg/iNOS ratio and CD163 expression in the cells. Furthermore, HA-PEI/pDNA-IL10 NPs significantly increased peritoneal and serum IL10 levels which effectively suppressed LPS-induced inflammation by reducing level of TNF-αand IL-1βin peritoneal macrophages and in the peritoneal fluid. The results demonstrated that pDNA-IL10-encapsulate HA-PEI NPs skewed macrophage functional polarity from M1 toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype which may be a promising platform for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.},

	Abstract = {Macrophages are vital regulators of the host defense in organisms. In response to different local microenvironments, resting macrophages (M0) can be polarized into different phenotypes, pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2), and perform different roles in different physiological or pathological conditions. Polarized macrophages can also be further reprogrammed by reversing their phenotype according to the changed milieu. Macrophage polarization and reprogramming play essential roles in maintaining the steady state of the immune system and are involved in the processes of many diseases. As foreign substances, nanoparticles (NPs) mainly target macrophages after entering the body. NPs can perturb the polarization and reprogramming of macrophages, affect their immunological function and, therefore, affect the pathological process of disease. Optimally-designed NPs for the modulation of macrophage polarization and reprogramming might provide new solutions for treating diseases. Systematically investigating how NPs affect macrophage polarization is crucial for understanding the regulatory effects of NPs on immune cells in vivo. In this review, macrophage polarization by NPs is summarized and discussed.},

	Abstract = {A major role of respiratory mucus is to trap inhaled particles, including pathogens and environmental particulates, to limit body exposure. Despite the tremendous health implications, how particle size and surface chemistry affect mobility in respiratory mucus from humans without lung disease is not known. We prepared polymeric nanoparticles densely coated with low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) to minimize muco-adhesion, and compared their transport to that of uncoated particles in human respiratory mucus, which we collected from the endotracheal tubes of surgical patients with no respiratory comorbidities. We found that 100 and 200 nm diameter PEG-coated particles rapidly penetrated respiratory mucus, at rates exceeding their uncoated counterparts by approximately 15- and 35-fold, respectively. In contrast, PEG-coated particles ≥500 nm in diameter were sterically immobilized by the mucus mesh. Thus, even though respiratory mucus is a viscoelastic solid at the macroscopic level (as measured using a bulk rheometer), nanoparticles that are sufficiently small and muco-inert can penetrate the mucus as if it were primarily a viscous liquid. These findings help elucidate the barrier properties of respiratory mucus and provide design criteria for therapeutic nanoparticles capable of penetrating mucus to approach the underlying airway epithelium.},

@article{Ryan2013Pulmonary-admin,
	Abstract = {The systemic delivery of drugs via the inhaled route is an attractive, needle-free means of improving the systemic exposure of molecules such as peptides and proteins that are poorly absorbed after oral administration. Directed delivery into the lungs also provides a means of increasing drug concentrations at the site of action for lung-specific disease states such as pulmonary infections and lung cancer. The current study has examined the potential utility of PEGylated polylysine dendrimers as pulmonary delivery agents and in particular sought to explore the relationship between dendrimer size and absorption of the intact construct (as a potential systemic delivery mechanism) versus retention within the lungs (as a potential pulmonary depot for controlled local release). Dendrimer absorption from the lungs was inversely correlated with molecular weight, with approximately 20-30% of the dose of relatively small (<22 kDa) dendrimers systemically absorbed compared to only 2% absorption for a larger (78 kDa) PEGylated dendrimer. Increasing the molecular weight of the dendrimers led to slower absorption and more prolonged retention in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Oral administration of the two smaller dendrimers confirmed that oral bioavailability of the PEGylated dendrimers was essentially zero and did not contribute to exposure after pulmonary administration. The smaller PEGylated dendrimers were also degraded in the lungs to low molecular weight products that were subsequently absorbed and excreted via the urine, while the larger constructs showed good stability in the lungs. The data suggest first, that small PEGylated dendrimer-based drug delivery systems may be delivered to the blood via inhalation, providing a more attractive alternative to injections, and second that larger PEGylated dendrimers may be retained in the lungs providing the potential for controlled delivery of medications to the blood or lung tissue.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Evaluation of in-vivo anticancer activity of aerosolized Celecoxib encapsulated Nanolipidcarriers (Cxb-NLC) as a single therapeutic agent and combined with intravenously administered Docetaxel (Doc) against non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Cxb-NLC were prepared by high-pressure homogenization and were characterized for its physicochemical characteristics. Metastatic A549 tumor model in Nu/Nu mice was used to evaluate response of aerosolized Cxb-NLC \& Doc. Isolated lung tumor samples were analyzed for: a) DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry, b) apoptotic and angiogenic protein markers by western blot, c) global proteomic alterations by an isobaric labeling quantitative proteomic method and d) toxicity studies of NLC. RESULTS: The particle size of Cxb-NLC was 217$\pm$20nm, while entrapment efficiency was more than 90{\%}. Cxb-NLC and Doc alone and in combination showed 25$\pm$4 {\%}, 37$\pm$5 {\%}, and 67$\pm$4 {\%} reduction in tumor size respectively compared to control. Proteomic analysis with combination treatment further revealed significantly decreased expression of multiple pro-survival and pro-metastasis proteins as well as tumor invasion markers and the expression of S100 family proteins, such as S100A6 and S100P were decreased by 2.5 and 1.6 fold. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with Cxb-NLC and Doc showed significant reduction in tumor growth which was further confirmed by proteomic analysis.},

@article{Nassimi2010A-toxicological,
	Abstract = {Inhalation is a non-invasive approach for both local and systemic drug delivery. This study aimed to define the therapeutic window for solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a drug delivery system by inhalation from a toxicological point of view. To estimate the toxic dose of SLNs in vitro, A549 cells and murine precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were exposed to increasing concentrations of SLNs. The cytotoxic effect of SLNs on A549 cells was evaluated by MTT and NRU assays. Viability of lung tissue was determined with WST assay and by life/dead staining using calcein AM/EthD-1 for confocal microscopy (CLSM) followed by quantitative analysis with IMARIS. Inflammation was assessed by measuring chemokine KC and TNF-alpha levels. The in vivo effects were determined in a 16-day repeated-dose inhalation toxicity study using female BALB/c mice, which were daily exposed to different concentrations of SLN30 aerosols (1-200 microg deposit dose). Local inflammatory effects in the respiratory tract were evaluated by determination of total protein content, LDH, chemokine KC, IL-6, and differential cell counts, performed on days 4, 8, 12, and 16 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, a histopathological evaluation of toxicologically relevant organs was accomplished. The in vitro and ex vivo dose finding experiments showed toxic effects beginning at concentrations of about 500 microg/ml. Therefore, we used 1-200 microg deposit doses/animal for the in vivo experiments. Even after 16 days of challenge with a 200-microg deposit dose, SLNs induced no significant signs of inflammation. We observed no consistent increase in LDH release, protein levels, or other signs of inflammation such as chemokine KC, IL-6, or neutrophilia. In contrast, the particle control (carbon black) caused inflammatory and cytotoxic effects at corresponding concentrations. These results confirm that repeated inhalation exposure to SLN30 at concentrations lower than a 200-microg deposit dose is safe in a murine inhalation model.},

	Abstract = {More than half of all people diagnosed with cancer receive chemotherapy. Unfortunately, most chemotherapy drugs cannot tell the difference between a cancer cell and a healthy cell. In this sense, some other drawbacks often encountered with antineoplastic compounds, such as poor stability and specificity and a high occurrence of drug-resistant tumor cells may be overcome to some degree by incorporating them into drug delivery systems. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have arisen considerable interest in recent years. These are particles of submicron size made from a lipid matrix that is solid at room and body temperature. Moreover, the biodegradable and biocompatible nature of SLN makes them less toxic than other nanoparticulate systems. SLN are capable of encapsulating hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, and they also provide protection against chemical, photochemical or oxidative degradation of drugs, as well as the possibility of a sustained release of the incorporated drugs. Along with these last issues, the feasibility of scaling up for large scale production and the low cost of lipids as compared to biodegradable polymers or phospholipids have favoured their use as potential drug delivery systems. This review focuses on the recent advances in SLN as carriers for chemotherapeutic agent delivery.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Growing attention has been given to the potential of pulmonary route as an alternative for non-invasive systemic delivery of therapeutic agents. In this study, novel nebulizer-compatible solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for pulmonary drug delivery of insulin were developed by reverse micelle-double emulsion method. The influences of the amount of sodium cholate (SC) and soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) on the deposition properties of the nanoparticles were investigated. Under optimal conditions, the entrapment delivery (ED), respirable fraction (RF) and nebulization efficiency (NE) of SLNs could reach 96.53, 82.11 and 63.28%, respectively, and Ins--SLNs remained stable during nebulization. Fasting plasma glucose level was reduced to 39.41% and insulin level was increased to approximately 170μIU/ml 4h after pulmonary administration of 20IU/kg Ins--SLNs. A pharmacological bioavailability of 24.33% and a relative bioavailability of 22.33% were obtained using subcutaneous injection as a reference. Incorporating fluorescent-labelled insulin into SLNs, we found that the SLNs were effectively and homogeneously distributed in the lung alveoli. These findings suggested that SLNs could be used as a potential carrier for pulmonary delivery of insulin by improving both in vitro and in vivo stability as well as prolonging hypoglycemic effect, which inevitably resulted in enhanced bioavailability.},

@article{El-Sherbiny2015Inhaled-nano--a,
	Abstract = {The 21st century has seen a paradigm shift to inhaled therapy, for both systemic and local drug delivery, due to the lung's favourable properties of a large surface area and high permeability. Pulmonary drug delivery possesses many advantages, including non-invasive route of administration, low metabolic activity, control environment for systemic absorption and avoids first bypass metabolism. However, because the lung is one of the major ports of entry, it has multiple clearance mechanisms, which prevent foreign particles from entering the body. Although these clearance mechanisms maintain the sterility of the lung, clearance mechanisms can also act as barriers to the therapeutic effectiveness of inhaled drugs. This effectiveness is also influenced by the deposition site and delivered dose. Particulate-based drug delivery systems have emerged as an innovative and promising alternative to conventional inhaled drugs to circumvent pulmonary clearance mechanisms and provide enhanced therapeutic efficiency and controlled drug release. The principle of multiple pulmonary clearance mechanisms is reviewed, including mucociliary, alveolar macrophages, absorptive, and metabolic degradation. This review also discusses the current approaches and formulations developed to achieve optimal pulmonary drug delivery systems.},

SLN/NLC have the particularity of being composed of excipientsalready approved for use in medicines for human use, which offers a great advantage over any other nanoparticulate system developed from novel materials. Despite this fact, any use of excipients in new route of administration or in new dosage form requires evidence of safety. After 25 years of research on SLN and NLC, enough evidence on their preclinical safety has been published. In the present work, published data on in vitro and in vivo compatibility of SLN/NLC have been surveyed, in order to provide evidence of high biocompatibility distinguished by intended administration route. We also identified critical factors and possible weak points in SLN/NLC formulations, such as the effect of surfactants on the cell viability in vitro, which should be considered for further development.},

	Abstract = {We describe the development and clinical translation of a targeted polymeric nanoparticle (TNP) containing the chemotherapeutic docetaxel (DTXL) for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. DTXL-TNP is targeted to prostate-specific membrane antigen, a clinically validated tumor antigen expressed on prostate cancer cells and on the neovasculature of most nonprostate solid tumors. DTXL-TNP was developed from a combinatorial library of more than 100 TNP formulations varying with respect to particle size, targeting ligand density, surface hydrophilicity, drug loading, and drug release properties. Pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies in rats showed that the NPs had a blood circulation half-life of about 20 hours and minimal liver accumulation. In tumor-bearing mice, DTXL-TNP exhibited markedly enhanced tumor accumulation at 12 hours and prolonged tumor growth suppression compared to a solvent-based DTXL formulation (sb-DTXL). In tumor-bearing mice, rats, and nonhuman primates, DTXL-TNP displayed pharmacokinetic characteristics consistent with prolonged circulation of NPs in the vascular compartment and controlled release of DTXL, with total DTXL plasma concentrations remaining at least 100-fold higher than sb-DTXL for more than 24 hours. Finally, initial clinical data in patients with advanced solid tumors indicated that DTXL-TNP displays a pharmacological profile differentiated from sb-DTXL, including pharmacokinetics characteristics consistent with preclinical data and cases of tumor shrinkage at doses below the sb-DTXL dose typically used in the clinic.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Current pulmonary treatments against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung suffer from deactivation of the drug and immobilization in thick and viscous biofilm/mucus blend, along with the general antibiotic resistance. Administration of nanoparticles (NPs) with high antibiotic load capable of penetrating the tight mesh of biofilm/mucus can be an advent to overcome the treatment bottlenecks. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymer nanoparticles efficiently loaded with ciprofloxacin complex offer a solution for emerging treatment strategies. NPs were prepared under controlled conditions by utilizing MicroJet Reactor (MJR) to yield a particle size of 190.4$\pm$28.6nm with 0.089 PDI. Encapsulation efficiency of the drug was 79% resulting in a loading of 14%. Release was determined to be controlled and medium-independent in PBS, PBS+0.2% Tween 80 and simulated lung fluid. Cytotoxicity assays with Calu-3 cells and CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o−) indicated that complex-loaded PLGA NPs were non-toxic at concentrations ≫ MICcipro against lab strains of the bacteria. Antibacterial activity tests revealed enhanced activity when applied as nanoparticles. NPs' colloidal stability in mucus was proven. Notably, a decrease in mucus turbidity was observed upon incubation with NPs. Herewith, ciprofloxacin complex-loaded PLGA NPs are introduced as promising pulmonary nano drug delivery systems against P.aeruginosa infections in CF lung.},

	Abstract = {Mipomersen sodium (Kynamro{\texttrademark}) (henceforth mipomersen) is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein B-100, which is the main structural component of atherogenic lipid particles. Mipomersen is administered via subcutaneous injection and is indicated as adjunctive treatment for homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH). The drug was developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals, which now collaborates with Genzyme Corporation for on-going development and product marketing. Multinational phase III trials of mipomersen as adjunctive therapy were completed in patients with HoFH, severe FH, heterozygous FH (HeFH) with coronary artery disease (CAD), and in those with hypercholesterolaemia at high risk of CAD. Mipomersen 200 mg once weekly has been approved in the USA as an adjunct to lipid-lowering medications and diet in HoFH patients and is undergoing regulatory review in the EU for the same indication. Genzyme is also conducting a multinational phase III, open-label extension study to evaluate long-term treatment in HoFH and HeFH patients, as well as a multinational trial to evaluate a three-times-per-week mipomersen regimen in patients with severe FH. This article summarises the milestones in the development of once-weekly, subcutaneous mipomersen leading to this first approval.},

@article{Hidalgo2017Pulmonary-surfa,
	Abstract = {Abstract Pulmonary surfactant is a membrane-based lipid-protein system essential for the process of breathing, which coats and stabilizes the whole respiratory surface and possesses exceptional biophysical properties. It constitutes the first barrier against the entry of pathogens and harmful particles in the alveolar region, extended through the lungs, but on the other hand, it can offer novel possibilities as a shuttle for the delivery of drugs and nanocarriers. The advances in nanotechnology are opening the doors to new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues, which are not accessible by means of the current approaches. In this context, the pulmonary route is called to become a powerful way of entry for innovative treatments based on nanotechnology.  In this review, the anatomy of the respiratory system and its properties for drug entry are first revisited, as well as some current strategies that use the respiratory route for both local and peripheral action. Then, a brief overview is presented on what pulmonary surfactant is, how it works and why it could be used as a drug delivery vehicle. Finally, the review is closed with a description of the development of nanocarriers in the lung context and their interaction with endogenous and clinical pulmonary surfactants.

Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is a novel, solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel (PTX). Although the incidence of nab-PTX-induced ILD is not clear, it is generally considered that this formulation presents a similar risk of developing ILD as PTX. Here, we report 3 patients who developed severe ILD following treatment with nab-PTX. We draw attention to the risk of developing drug-induced ILD following nab-PTX treatment, and highlight that this novel formulation might therefore not be as safe as PTX with respect to the development of ILD.},

	Abstract = {Normal airway mucus lines the epithelial surface and provides an important innate immune function by detoxifying noxious molecules and by trapping and removing pathogens and particulates from the airway via mucociliary clearance. The major macromolecular constituents of normal mucus, the mucin glycoproteins, are large, heavily glycosylated proteins with a defining feature of tandemly repeating sequences of amino acids rich in serine and threonine, the linkage sites for large carbohydrate structures. The mucins are composed of two major families: secreted mucins and membrane-associated mucins. Membrane-associated mucins have been reported to function as cell surface receptors for pathogens and to activate intracellular signaling pathways. The biochemical and cellular functions for secreted mucin glycoproteins have not been definitively assigned. In contrast to normal mucus, sputum production is the hallmark of chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis (CF). Sputum has altered macromolecular composition and biophysical properties which vary with disease, but unifying features are failure of mucociliary clearance, resulting in airway obstruction, and failure of innate immune properties. Mucin glycoprotein overproduction and hypersecretion are common features of chronic inflammatory airway disease, and this has been the underlying rationale to investigate the mechanisms of mucin gene regulation and mucin secretion. However, in some pathologic conditions such as CF, airway sputum contains little intact mucin and has increased content of several macromolecules including DNA, filamentous actin, lipids, and proteoglycans. This review will highlight the most recent insights on mucus biology in health and disease.},

@article{Rubin2009Mucus-Phlegm-an,
	Abstract = {Although some clinicians still believe that cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is largely due to hypersecretion of very viscous mucus, it has never been demonstrated that there is mucus hypersecretion in CF and it is clear that there is almost no intact mucin (the principal polymeric component of normal mucus) in CF sputum. CF sputum has lower viscosity when compared to asthma or bronchitis sputa, but is highly tenacious and biochemically most closely resembles pus. Tenacity and lower viscosity lead to decreased cough clearance of infected phlegm, which is thought to induce a persistent inflammatory state in the airway, leading to bronchiectasis. There are many medications and devices either in use or under development that are meant to improve airway hygiene in CF by assisting with sputum expectoration. This paper discusses the scientific basis and potential mechanism of action for many of these interventions and briefly reviews the clinical evidence of their safety and effectiveness.},

@article{Sbalzarini2005Feature-point-t,
	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary emphysema, a major component of COPD, is pathologically characterized by destructive alterations in pulmonary architectures as a result of persistent inflammation. However, alterations in the turnover of pulmonary cells are less well understood. This study was designed to examine whether the turnover of alveolar wall cells is altered in patients with emphysema. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: We obtained lung tissue specimens from patients with emphysema who had undergone lung volume reduction surgery (13 patients) as well as asymptomatic smokers (7 patients) and nonsmokers (9 patients) undergoing lung resections for solitary lung cancers. Paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were evaluated for apoptosis and proliferation using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) or immunohistochemistry for Bax, proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and topoisomerase IIalpha. Tissue sections were also immunostained for epithelial membrane antigen, surfactant protein A, and CD31. RESULTS: The percentages of alveolar wall cells undergoing apoptosis and proliferation of the total number of alveolar wall cells were significantly higher in patients with emphysema than in asymptomatic smokers and nonsmokers (p < 0.05). The percentage of TUNEL-positive alveolar wall cells was positively correlated with the percentage of PCNA-positive alveolar wall cells. Most of the TUNEL-positive and PCNA-positive cells were alveolar epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the turnover of alveolar wall cells is enhanced in emphysematous lungs, compared to healthy lungs. Emphysema may be a dynamic disease process in which alveolar wall cell death and proliferation are repeated.},

	Abstract = {There is heterogeneity in the propensity of smokers to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and improved treatment strategies are hindered by limited understanding of COPD pathogenesis, especially as distinct from the effects of smoking per se. Although apoptosis is essential for tissue homeostasis, increased apoptosis may cause tissue damage and inflammation. This study addressed whether airway T-lymphocytes and airway epithelial cells (AEC) show an increased likelihood of undergoing apoptosis in COPD and if this was related to smoking. Apoptosis (7-amino-actinomycin D, Annexin, single-stranded DNA and caspase), Bcl-2, Bax and p53 were assessed in cells obtained from bronchial bushing and bronchoalveolar lavage from ex- and continuing smokers with COPD, and nonsmoking controls, using flow cytometry. A mean 87\% increase in apoptosis of AEC and a 103\% increase in T-lymphocyte apoptosis were found in COPD. There were no significant differences in apoptosis of AEC between current and ex-smokers with COPD. Apoptosis may contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis, and continued excess apoptosis after smoking cessation may offer a new target for therapeutic interventions. Whether the persistence of increased apoptosis after smoking cessation results from changes in the pulmonary milleau after years of noxious insult, or whether some individuals have a natural predisposition toward increased apoptosis and possible development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains to be determined.},

@article{Zhou2016Autophagy-plays,
	Abstract = {Mucus hypersecretion is a common pathological feature of chronic airway inflammatory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the molecular basis for this condition remains incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated a critical role of autophagy in COPD pathogenesis through mediating apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the function of autophagy as well as its upstream and downstream signals in cigarette smoke-induced mucus production in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and in mouse airways. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE), as well as the classical autophagy inducers starvation or Torin-1, significantly triggered MUC5AC expression, and inhibition of autophagy markedly attenuated CSE-induced mucus production. The CSE-induced autophagy was mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS), which regulated mucin expression through the JNK and activator protein-1 pathway. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also required for CSE-induced MUC5AC in HBE cells, but it exerted inconsiderable effects on the autophagy-JNK signaling cascade. Airways of mice with dysfunctional autophagy-related genes displayed a markedly reduced number of goblet cells and attenuated levels of Muc5ac in response to cigarette smoke exposure. These results altogether suggest that mitoROS-dependent autophagy is essential for cigarette smoke-induced mucus hyperproduction in airway epithelial cells, and reemphasize autophagy inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic airway diseases.},

@article{Sethi2006Airway-inflamma,
	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Inflammation is now recognized as an integral part of the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In contrast to the sterile airways of normal lungs, bacterial pathogens are often isolated from the airways in stable COPD. This "colonization" of the tracheobronchial tree, currently believed to be innocuous, could serve as an inflammatory stimulus, independent of current tobacco smoke exposure. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that bacterial colonization is associated with airway inflammation in stable COPD. METHODS: Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in three groups of subjects: 26 ex-smokers with stable COPD (COPD), 20 ex-smokers without COPD (ex-smokers), and 15 healthy nonsmokers (nonsmokers). Quantitative bacterial cultures, cell counts, chemokine, cytokine, proteinase/antiproteinase, and endotoxin levels in the BAL fluid were compared. RESULTS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria were recovered at > or = 100 cfu/ml in 34.6% of COPD, 0% of ex-smokers, and in 6.7% of nonsmokers (p = 0.003). All values are expressed as median (interquartile range). Subjects with colonized COPD had significantly greater relative (12.0 [28.4] vs. 3.0 [7.8]%, p = 0.03) and absolute (4.98 [5.26] x 10(4)/ml vs. 3.04 [2.82] x 10(4)/ml, p = 0.02) neutrophil counts, interleukin 8 (33.8 [189.8] vs. 16.9 [20.1] pg/ml, p = 0.005), active matrix metalloproteinase-9 (2.16 [4.30] vs. 0.84 [0.99] U/ml, p = 0.03), and endotoxin (36.0 [72.6] vs. 3.55 [7.17] mEU/ml, p = 0.004) levels in the BAL than the subjects with noncolonized COPD. These inflammatory constituents of BAL were also significantly elevated in subjects with colonized COPD when compared with ex-smokers and nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization is associated with neutrophilic airway lumen inflammation in ex-smokers with COPD and could contribute to progression of airway disease in COPD.},

	Abstract = {Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone to frequent exacerbations which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Stable COPD patients often have lower airway bacterial colonisation which may be an important stimulus to airway inflammation and thereby modulate exacerbation frequency. Methods: Twenty nine patients with COPD (21 men, 16 current smokers) of mean (SD) age 65.9 (7.84) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 1.06 (0.41) l, FEV1 \% predicted 38.7 (15.2)\%, FEV1/FVC 43.7 (14.1)\%, inhaled steroid dosage 1.20 (0.66) mg/day completed daily diary cards for symptoms and peak flow over 18 months. Exacerbation frequency rates were determined from diary card data. Induced sputum was obtained from patients in the stable state, quantitative bacterial culture was performed, and cytokine levels were measured. Results: Fifteen of the 29 patients (51.7\%) were colonised by a possible pathogen: Haemophilus influenzae (53.3\%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (33.3\%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (20\%), Branhamella catarrhalis (20\%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20\%). The presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state was related to exacerbation frequency (p=0.023). Patients colonised by H influenzae in the stable state reported more symptoms and increased sputum purulence at exacerbation than those not colonised. The median (IQR) symptom count at exacerbation in those colonised by H influenzae was 2.00 (2.00{\textendash}2.65) compared with 2.00 (1.00{\textendash}2.00) in those not colonised (p=0.03). The occurrence of increased sputum purulence at exacerbation per patient was 0.92 (0.56{\textendash}1.00) in those colonised with H influenzae and 0.33 (0.00{\textendash}0.60) in those not colonised (p=0.02). Sputum interleukin (IL)-8 levels correlated with the total bacterial count (rho=0.459, p=0.02). Conclusion: Lower airway bacterial colonisation in the stable state modulates the character and frequency of COPD exacerbations.},

@article{Bjarnsholt2015Antibiofilm-Pro,
	Abstract = {Bacterial biofilms are known to be extremely tolerant toward antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. These biofilms cause the persistence of chronic infections. Since antibiotics rarely resolve these infections, the only effective treatment of chronic infections is surgical removal of the infected implant, tissue, or organ and thereby the biofilm. Acetic acid is known for its antimicrobial effect on bacteria in general, but has never been thoroughly tested for its efficacy against bacterial biofilms. In this article, we describe complete eradication of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative biofilms using acetic acid both as a liquid and as a dry salt. In addition, we present our clinical experience of acetic acid treatment of chronic wounds. In conclusion, we here present the first comprehensive in vitro and in vivo testing of acetic acid against bacterial biofilms.},

@article{Zeyland2013Transgenic-pigs,
	Abstract = {The use of animals as a source of organs and tissues for xenotransplantation can overcome the growing shortage of human organ donors. However, the presence of xenoreactive antibodies in humans directed against swine Gal antigen present on the surface of xenograft donor cells leads to the complement activation and immediate xenograft rejection as a consequence of hyperacute reaction. To prevent hyperacute rejection, it is possible to change the swine genome by a human gene modifying the set of donor's cell surface proteins. The gene construct pGal-GFPBsd containing the human gene encoding α-galactosidase enzyme under the promoter of EF-1αelongation factor ensuring systemic expression was introduced by microinjection into a male pronucleus of the fertilised porcine oocyte. As a result, the founder male pig was obtained with the transgene mapping to chromosome 11p12. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed and the Southern analysis confirmed transgene integration estimating the approximate number of transgene copies as 16. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a reduction in the level of epitope Gal on the cell surface of cells isolated from F0 and F1 transgenic animals. The complement-mediated cytotoxicity assay showed increased viability of the transgenic cells in comparison with the wild-type, which confirmed the protective influence of α-galactosidase expression.},

@article{Fu2011A-New-Electrosp,
	Abstract = {A new single-capillary electrospray (ES) aerosol generator has been developed for monodisperse particle production with maximal transmission efficiency. The new generator consists of both a spray chamber in a point-to-orifice-plate configuration and a charge reduction chamber that can hold up to 4 Nuclespot ionizers (Model P-2042, NRD Inc.). The 2 chambers are partitioned by an orifice plate. To optimize the particle transmission efficiency of the prototype, a systematic study was performed on the generator by varying the system setup and operation. Two key dimensions of the generator setup, the orifice diameter and the distance from the capillary tip to the orifice plate, were varied. Fluorescence analysis was applied to characterize the loss of ES-generated particles at different locations of the prototype. It was found that particle loss in the generator could be reduced by either increasing the orifice diameter or decreasing the distance between the capillary tip and the orifice plate. Increasing either the total radioactivity of the ionizers or the flowrate of the particle carrier gas also further decreased the particle loss in the system. The maximum particle transmission efficiency of 88.0{\%} was obtained with the spray chamber fully opened to the charge reduction chamber, the capillary tip at the same level as the orifice plate, and 4 bipolar ionizers installed.},

@article{Kuljanin2017Collagenase-tre,
	Abstract = {There is great interest in the application of advanced proteomic techniques to characterize decellularized tissues in order to develop a deeper understanding of the effects of the complex extracellular matrix (ECM) composition on the cellular response to these pro-regenerative bioscaffolds. However, the identification of proteins in ECM-derived bioscaffolds is hindered by the high abundance of collagen in the samples, which can interfere with the detection of lower-abundance constituents that may be important regulators of cell function. To address this limitation, we developed a novel multi-enzyme digestion approach using treatment with a highly-purified collagenase derived from Clostridium Histolyticum to selectively deplete collagen from ECM-derived protein extracts, reducing its relative abundance from up to 90{\%} to below 10{\%}. Moreover, we applied this new method to characterize the proteome of human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT), human decellularized cancellous bone (DCB), and commercially-available bovine tendon collagen (BTC). We successfully demonstrated with all three sources that collagenase treatment increased the depth of detection and enabled the identification of a variety of signaling proteins that were masked by collagen in standard digestion protocols with trypsin/LysC, increasing the number of proteins identified in the DAT by ∼2.2 fold, the DCB by ∼1.3 fold, and the BTC by ∼1.6 fold. In addition, quantitative proteomics using label-free quantification demonstrated that the DAT and DCB extracts were compositionally distinct, and identified a number of adipogenic and osteogenic proteins that were consistently more highly expressed in the DAT and DCB respectively. Overall, we have developed a new processing method that may be applied in advanced mass spectrometry studies to improve the high-throughput proteomic characterization of bioscaffolds derived from mammalian tissues. Further, our study provides new insight into the complex ECM composition of two human decellularized tissues of interest as cell-instructive platforms for regenerative medicine.},

@article{Rojas2016A-Positive-TGF-,
	Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is globally the second most common cause of cancer mortality. The majority of HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stage disease for which no curative treatments exist. TGF-βhas been identified as a potential therapeutic target. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating its functional switch from a tumor suppressor to tumor promoter in HCC and its interactions with other signaling pathways are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an aberrant molecular network between the TGF-βand c-KIT pathway that mediates the functional switch of TGF-βto a driver of tumor progression in HCC. TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling transcriptionally regulates expression of the c-KIT receptor ligand (stem cell factor {$[$}SCF{$]$}) with subsequent auto- and paracrine activation of c-KIT/JAK1/STAT3 signaling. SCF induces TGF-β1 ligand expression via STAT3, thereby forming a positive feedback loop between TGF-β/SMAD and SCF/c-KIT signaling. This network neutralizes TGF-β--mediated cell cycle inhibition and induces tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition, migration, and invasion. Disruption of this feedback loop inhibits TGF-βtumor-promoting effects and restores its antiproliferative functions. Consistent with our in vitro data, we demonstrate SCF overexpression and its correlation to SMAD2 and STAT3 activation in human HCC tumors, advanced tumor-node-metastasis stages, and shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS: Canonical TGF-βand c-KIT signaling forms a positive, tumor-promoting feedback loop. Disruption of this loop restores TGF-βtumor suppressor function and provides the rationale for targeting the TGF-β/SCF axis as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.},

	Abstract = {Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) initiates HBV-associated fibrogenesis. The mechanism of TGF-β1 modulating HSC activation is not fully uncovered. We hypothesized a positive feedback signaling loop of TGF-β1-CD147 promoting liver fibrogenesis by activation of HSCs. Human HSC cell line LX-2 and spontaneous liver fibrosis model derived from HBV transgenic mice were used to evaluate the activation of molecules in the signaling loop. Wound healing and cell contraction assay were performed to detect the CD147-overexpressed HSC migration and contraction. The transcriptional regulation of CD147 by TGF-β1/Smad4 was determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We found that a positive reciprocal regulation between TGF-β1 and CD147 mediated HSC activation. CD147 over-expression promoted HSC migration and accelerated TGF-β1-induced cell contraction. Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in cooperation with Smad4 mediated the TGF-β1-regulated CD147 expression. Smad4 activated the transcription by direct interaction with CD147 promoter. Meanwhile, CD147 modulated the activated phenotype of HSCs through the ERK1/2 and Sp1 which up-regulated α-SMA, collagen I, and TGF-β1 synthesis. These findings indicate that TGF-β1-CD147 loop plays a key role in regulating the HSC activation and combination of TGF-βreceptor inhibitor and anti-CD147 antibody might be promised to reverse fibrogenesis.},

@article{Benchabane2003GATA--and-Smad1,
	Abstract = {Smad7, an inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta superfamily signaling, is induced by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in an inhibitory feedback loop. Here, we identify multiple BMP response elements (BREs) in the Smad7 gene and demonstrate that they function differentially to interpret BMP signals in a cell type-specific manner. Two BREs (BRE-1 and -2) reside in the promoter region. One of these contains several conserved Smad1 and Smad4 binding sites that cooperate to mediate BMP-dependent induction, most likely in the absence of DNA binding partners. The third BRE (I-BRE) resides in the first intron and contains GATA factor binding sites. GATA-1, -5, or -6 is required for strong activation of I-BRE, and we show that they assemble with Smad1 on the I-BRE in living cells. Activation of the I-BRE is mediated by a specific region in GATA-5 and -6 but does not require direct physical interaction with Smad1. Comparison of I-BRE to BRE-1 showed that I-BRE is more responsive to low BMP concentrations. Moreover, analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrates that the endogenous I-BRE is occupied more robustly by endogenous Smad1 than is BRE-1. This correlates with regulation of the Smad7 gene, which is induced at lower BMP concentrations in GATA-expressing cell lines compared to non-GATA-expressing lines. These data thus define how cooperative and noncooperative Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation can function to interpret different BMP concentrations.},

	Abstract = {Lens epithelial cells undergo epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT) after injury as in cataract extraction, leading to fibrosis of the lens capsule. We have previously shown that EMT of primary lens epithelial cells in vitro depends on TGF-βexpression and more specifically, on signaling via Smad3. In this report, we suggest phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling is also necessary for TGF-β-induced EMT in lens epithelial cells by showing that LY294002, an inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, blocked the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and morphological changes. We also identify Snail as an effector of TGF-β-induced EMT. Snail has been shown to be a mediator of EMT during metastasis of cancer. We show that Snail is an immediate-early response gene for TGF-βand the proximal Snail promoter is activated by TGF-βthrough the action of Smad2, 3, and 4. We show that antisense inhibition of Snail expression blocks TGF-β-induced EMT and furthermore Akt activation. All of these findings suggest that Snail participates in TGF-β-induced EMT by acting upstream of Akt activation.},

@article{Wipff2007Myofibroblast-c,
	Abstract = {The conjunctive presence of mechanical stress and active transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is essential to convert fibroblasts into contractile myofibroblasts, which cause tissue contractures in fibrotic diseases. Using cultured myofibroblasts and conditions that permit tension modulation on the extracellular matrix (ECM), we establish that myofibroblast contraction functions as a mechanism to directly activate TGF-β1 from self-generated stores in the ECM. Contraction of myofibroblasts and myofibroblast cytoskeletons prepared with Triton X-100 releases active TGF-β1 from the ECM. This process is inhibited either by antagonizing integrins or reducing ECM compliance and is independent from protease activity. Stretching myofibroblast-derived ECM in the presence of mechanically apposing stress fibers immediately activates latent TGF-β1. In myofibroblast-populated wounds, activation of the downstream targets of TGF-β1 signaling Smad2/3 is higher in stressed compared to relaxed tissues despite similar levels of total TGF-β1 and its receptor. We propose activation of TGF-β1 via integrin-mediated myofibroblast contraction as a potential checkpoint in the progression of fibrosis, restricting autocrine generation of myofibroblasts to a stiffened ECM.},

	Abstract = {Veins grafted into an arterial environment undergo a complex vascular remodeling process. Pathologic vascular remodeling often results in stenosed or occluded conduit grafts. Understanding this complex process is important for improving the outcome of patients with coronary and peripheral artery disease undergoing surgical revascularization. Using in vivo murine cell lineage{\textendash}tracing models, we show that endothelial-derived cells contribute to neointimal formation through endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which is dependent on early activation of the Smad2/3-Slug signaling pathway. Antagonism of transforming growth factor{\textendash}β (TGF-β) signaling by TGF-β neutralizing antibody, short hairpin RNA{\textendash}mediated Smad3 or Smad2 knockdown, Smad3 haploinsufficiency, or endothelial cell{\textendash}specific Smad2 deletion resulted in decreased EndMT and less neointimal formation compared to controls. Histological examination of postmortem human vein graft tissue corroborated the changes observed in our mouse vein graft model, suggesting that EndMT is operative during human vein graft remodeling. These data establish that EndMT is an important mechanism underlying neointimal formation in interpositional vein grafts, and identifies the TGF-β{\textendash}Smad2/3{\textendash}Slug signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target to prevent clinical vein graft stenosis.},

	N2 = {The ability of high-risk neuroblastoma to survive unfavorable growth conditions and multimodal therapy has produced an elusive childhood cancer with remarkably poor prognosis. A novel phenomenon enabling neuroblastoma to survive selection pressure is its capacity for reversible adaptive plasticity. This plasticity allows cells to transition between highly proliferative anchorage dependent (AD) and slow growing, anoikis-resistant anchorage independent (AI) phenotypes. Both phenotypes are present in established mouse and human tumors. The differential gene expression profile of the two cellular phenotypes in the mouse Neuro2a cell line delineated pathways of proliferation in AD cells or tyrosine kinase activation/ apoptosis inhibition in AI cells. A 20 fold overexpression of inhibitor of differentiation 2 (Id2) was identified in AD cells while up-regulation of genes involved in anoikis resistance like PI3K/Akt, Erk, Bcl2 and integrins was observed in AI cells. Similarly, differential expression of Id2 and other genes of interest were also observed in the AD and AI phenotypes of human neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-SH and IMR-32; as well as in primary human tumor specimens. Forced down-regulation of Id2 in AD cells or overexpression in AI cells induced the cells to gain characteristics of the other phenotype. Id2 binds both TGFβand Smad2/3 and appears critical for maintaining the proliferative phenotype at least partially through negative regulation of the TGFβ/Smad pathway. Simultaneously targeting the differential molecular pathways governing reversible adaptive plasticity resulted in 50{\%} cure of microscopic disease and delayed tumor growth in established mouse neuroblastoma tumors. We present a mechanism that accounts for reversible adaptive plasticity and a molecular basis for combined targeted therapies in neuroblastoma.},

@article{Nawshad2007TGFbeta3-inhibi,
	Abstract = {Dissociation of medial-edge epithelium (MEE) during palate development is essential for mediating correct craniofacial morphogenesis. This phenomenon is initiated by TGFbeta3 upon adherence of opposing palatal shelves, because loss of E-cadherin causes the MEE seam to break into small epithelial islands. To investigate the molecular mechanisms that cause this E-cadherin loss, we isolated and cultured murine embryonic primary MEE cells from adhered or non-adhered palates. Here, we provide the first evidence that lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1), when functionally activated by phosphorylated Smad2 (Smad2-P) and Smad4 (rather than beta-catenin), binds with the promoter of the E-cadherin gene to repress its transcription in response to TGFbeta3 signaling. Furthermore, we found that TGFbeta3 signaling stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and cell migration in these cells. LEF1 and Smad4 were found to be necessary for up-regulation of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin, independently of beta-catenin. We proved that TGFbeta3 signaling induces EMT in MEE cells by forming activated transcription complexes of Smad2-P, Smad4 and LEF1 that directly inhibit E-cadherin gene expression.},

@article{Mjaatvedt1987Myocardial-spec,
	Abstract = {The early chick heart tube consists of myocardium and endothelium separated by a myocardially derived basement membrane (MBM). As development proceeds, the endothelium undergoes a transition into mesenchyme in a regionally specific manner; only the atrioventricular (AV) and outflow tract, but not the ventricular endothelium, is transformed into mesenchyme, the progenitor of heart septa and valves. Recent experiments have shown that an EDTA extract of MBM can initiate AV endothelium to form mesenchyme in an in vitro collagen gel culture system. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of AV region EDTA extracts showed potentially three isoelectric forms of fibronectin (Fn), while extracts from ventricle contained only two forms. The purpose of the present study was to further investigate the significance of these regional differences by (1) testing of specific myocardial regions (AV vs ventricle) for their ability to induce endothelium to form mesenchyme in vitro, and (2) to immunohistochemically determine if a regionally specific distribution of Fn exists in the MBM that can be correlated with previous electrophoretic data. Embryonic heart regions cultured on three-dimensional collagen gels showed that AV endothelium could only form mesenchyme if cocultured with AV myocardium. Coculture with ventricular myocardial explants did not initiate differentiation of AV endothelium. In contrast, ventricular endothelial cells did not form mesenchyme when cocultured with AV or ventricle myocardium. Immunohistochemical localization of Fn revealed three distinct morphological patterns of distribution in the AV-MBM, i.e., an intense lamina densa staining, diffuse staining in fibrils, and as particles. The Fn localized in particles (0.1 to 0.5 μm in diameter) appeared as a gradient of decreasing concentration extending from the myocardium toward the endothelium. In constrast, no particulate Fn staining was observed in the ventricular region. EDTA extraction selectively depleted the particulate form of Fn. Previous work has shown that this extract, which contains several lower Mr proteins in addition to Fn, is biologically active in initiating mesenchyme formation from AV endothelium in vitro. These results show that a regionally specific interaction of the myocardium with the endothelium is required to initiate the formation of prevalvular mesenchyme. This interaction may be mediated by a multicomponent complex involving Fn and other proteins which appear as a regionally distinct particulate only in areas of endothelial differentiation.},

@article{Itoh2004Synergy-and-ant,
	Abstract = {Notch and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways are important for cellular differentiation, and both have been implicated in vascular development. In many cases the two pathways act similarly, but antagonistic effects have also been reported. The underlying mechanisms and whether this is caused by an interplay between Notch and BMP signaling is unknown. Here we report that expression of the Notch target gene, Herp2, is synergistically induced upon activation of Notch and BMP receptor signaling pathways in endothelial cells. The synergy is mediated via RBP-Jκ/CBF-1 and GC-rich palindromic sites in the Herp2 promoter, as well as via interactions between the Notch intracellular domain and Smad that are stabilized by p/CAF. Activated Notch and its downstream effector Herp2 were found to inhibit endothelial cell (EC) migration. In contrast, BMP via upregulation of Id1 expression has been reported to promote EC migration. Interestingly, Herp2 was found to antagonize BMP receptor/Id1-induced migration by inhibiting Id1 expression. Our results support the notion that Herp2 functions as a critical switch downstream of Notch and BMP receptor signaling pathways in ECs.},

@article{Hata1998Smad6-inhibits-,
	Abstract = {Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors signal by phosphorylating Smad1, which then associates with Smad4; this complex moves into the nucleus and activates transcription. Here we report the existence of a natural inhibitor of this process, Smad6, a longer version of the previously reported JV15-1. In Xenopus embryos and in mammalian cells, Smad6 specifically blocks signaling by the BMP/Smad1 pathway. Smad6 inhibits BMP/Smad1 signaling without interfering with receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1. Smad6 specifically competes with Smad4 for binding to receptor-activated Smad1, yielding an apparently inactive Smad1--Smad6 complex. Therefore, Smad6 selectively antagonizes BMP-activated Smad1 by acting as a Smad4 decoy.},

	Abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes, and is regulated by signaling pathways mediated by cytokines, including transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). Embryonic endothelial cells also undergo differentiation into mesenchymal cells during heart valve formation and aortic maturation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate such endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) remain to be elucidated. Here we show that TGFβ plays important roles during mural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (MESECs). TGFβ2 induced the differentiation of MESECs into mural cells, with a decrease in the expression of the endothelial marker claudin 5, and an increase in expression of the mural markers smooth muscle α-actin, SM22α and calponin, whereas a TGFβ type I receptor kinase inhibitor inhibited EndMT. Among the transcription factors involved in EMT, Snail was induced by TGFβ2 in MESECs. Tetracycline-regulated expression of Snail induced the differentiation of MESECs into mural cells, whereas knockdown of Snail expression abrogated TGFβ2-induced mural differentiation of MESECs. These results indicate that Snail mediates the actions of endogenous TGFβ signals that induce EndMT.},

	Abstract = {Background{\textemdash} Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multifunctional proteins that regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of a large variety of cell types. Like other members of the transforming growth factor-β family, BMPs elicit their cellular effects through activating specific combinations of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors and their downstream effector proteins, which are termed Smads. In the present study, we investigated BMP receptor/Smad expression and signaling in endothelial cells (ECs) and examined the effects of BMP on EC behavior.Methods and Results{\textemdash} Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections of human colon and mouse heart and aorta showed that BMP receptors are expressed in ECs in vivo. Bovine aortic ECs and mouse embryonic ECs were found to express BMP receptors and their Smads. BMP receptor activation induced the phosphorylation of specific Smad proteins and promoted EC migration and tube formation. Id1 was identified as a BMP/Smad target in ECs. Ectopic expression of Id1 mimicked BMP-induced effects. Importantly, specific interference with Id1 expression blocked BMP-induced EC migration.Conclusions{\textemdash} The BMP/Smad pathway can potently activate the endothelium. Id1 expression is strongly induced by BMP in ECs. Ectopic expression of Id1 induces EC migration and tube formation. Moreover, Id1 played a critical role in mediating BMP-induced EC migration.Received April 22, 2002; revision received July 29, 2002; accepted July 29, 2002.},

@article{Song2011Cell-autonomous,
	Abstract = {Atrioventricular (AV) cushions are the precursors of AV septum and valves. In this study, we examined roles of Smad4 during AV cushion development using a conditional gene inactivation approach. We found that endothelial/endocardial inactivation of Smad4 led to the hypocellular AV cushion defect and that both reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis contributed to the defect. Expression of multiple genes critical for cushion development was down-regulated in mutant embryos. In collagen gel assays, the number of mesenchymal cells formed is significantly reduced in mutant AV explants compared to that in control explants, suggesting that the reduction of cushion mesenchyme formation in mutants is unlikely secondary to their gross vasculature abnormalities. Using a previously developed immortal endocardial cell line, we showed that Smad4 is required for BMP signaling- stimulated upregulation of Tbx20 and Gata4. Therefore, our data collectively support the cell-autonomous requirement of endocardial Smad4 in regulating AV cushion development. Developmental Dynamics, 2011. {\copyright}2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Mouillesseaux2016Notch-regulates,
	Abstract = {{Functional blood vessel growth depends on generation of distinct but
   coordinated responses from endothelial cells. Bone morphogenetic
   proteins (BMP), part of the TGF beta superfamily, bind receptors to
   induce phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD transcription
   factors (R-SMAD1/5/8) and regulate vessel growth. However, SMAD1/5/8
   signalling results in both pro-and anti-angiogenic outputs, highlighting
   a poor understanding of the complexities of BMP signalling in the
   vasculature. Here we show that BMP6 and BMP2 ligands are pro-angiogenic
   in vitro and in vivo, and that lateral vessel branching requires
   threshold levels of R-SMAD phosphorylation. Endothelial cell
   responsiveness to these pro-angiogenic BMP ligands is regulated by Notch
   status and Notch sets responsiveness by regulating a cell-intrinsic BMP
   inhibitor, SMAD6, which affects BMP responses upstream of target gene
   expression. Thus, we reveal a paradigm for Notch-dependent regulation of
   angiogenesis: Notch regulates SMAD6 expression to affect BMP
   responsiveness of endothelial cells and new vessel branch formation.}},

@article{Vitali2014The-Sugen-5416/,
	Abstract = {The combination of a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist, Sugen 5416 (SU5416), and chronic hypoxia is known to cause pronounced pulmonary hypertension (PH) with angioobliterative lesions in rats and leads to exaggerated PH in mice as well. We sought to determine whether weekly SU5416 injections during 3 weeks of hypoxia leads to long-term development of angioobliterative lesions and sustained or progressive PH in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were injected with SU5416 (SuHx) or vehicle (VehHx) weekly during 3 weeks of exposure to 10{\%} oxygen. Echocardiographic and invasive measures of hemodynamics and pulmonary vascular morphometry were performed after the 3-week hypoxic exposure and after 10 weeks of recovery in normoxia. SuHx led to higher right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure and RV hypertrophy than VehHx after 3 weeks of hypoxia. Ten weeks after hypoxic exposure, RV systolic pressure decreased but remained elevated in SuHx mice compared with VehHx or normoxic control mice, but RV hypertrophy had resolved. After 3 weeks of hypoxia and 10 weeks of follow-up in normoxia, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was significantly decreased, indicating decreased systolic RV function. Very few angioobliterative lesions were found at the 10-week follow-up time point in SuHx mouse lungs. In conclusion, SU5416 combined with 3 weeks of hypoxia causes a more profound PH phenotype in mice than hypoxia alone. PH persists over 10 weeks of normoxic follow-up in SuHx mice, but significant angioobliterative lesions do not occur, and neither PH nor RV dysfunction worsens. The SuHx mouse model is a useful adjunct to other PH models, but the search will continue for a mouse model that better recapitulates the human phenotype.},

@article{Siavashi2016ECM-Dependence-,
	Abstract = {Preserving self-renewal, multipotent capacity, and large-scale expansion of highly functional progenitor cells, including endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), is a controversial issue. These current limitations, therefore, raise the need of developing promising in vitro conditions for prolonged expansion of EPCs without loss of their stemness feature. In the current study, the possible role of three different natural extracellular substrates, including collagen, gelatin, and fibronectin, on multiple parameters of EPCs such as cell morphology, phenotype, clonogenic, and vasculogenic properties was scrutinized. Next, EPCs from GFP-positive mice were pre-expanded on each of these ECM substrates and then systemically transplanted into sublethaly irradiated mice to analyze the potency of these cells for marrow reconstitution. Our results revealed considerable promise for fibronectin for EPC expansion with maintenance of stemness characteristics, whereas gelatin and collagen matrices directed the cells toward a mature endothelial phenotype. Transplantation of EPCs pre-expanded on fibronectin resulted in widespread distribution and appropriate engraftment to various tissues with habitation in close association with the microvasculature. In addition, fibronectin pre-expanded cells were gradually enriched in the bone marrow after transplantation, resulting in marrow repopulation and hematologic recovery, leading to improved survival of recipient mice whereas gelatin- and collagen-expanded cells failed to reconstitute the bone marrow. This study demonstrated that, cell characteristics of in vitro expanded EPCs are determined by the subjacent matrix. Fibronectin-expanded EPCs are heralded as a source of great promise for bone marrow reconstitution and neo-angiogenesis in therapeutic bone marrow transplantation. J. Cell.

@article{Kniazeva2009Endothelial-cel,
	Abstract = {Identifying the mechanisms regulating angiogenesis in pathological conditions such as cancer and heart disease is crucial to develop successful therapies. The dependence of angiogenesis on characteristic properties of these conditions, such as alterations in tissue stiffness due to changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), may shed light on potential therapeutic strategies. Prior studies have suggested that ECM compliance regulates capillary morphogenesis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that ECM density, which influences substrate mechanics, may regulate angiogenesis via a mechanism involving actin-mediated cell-generated forces. To investigate this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro model of angiogenesis in which endothelial cells coated on microcarrier beads are distributed within a three-dimensional (3-D) fibrin ECM. A monolayer of fibroblasts, which provides pro-angiogenic factors, is cultured on top of the gel. Variations in fibrin gel density, along with a library of pharmacological agents that inhibit forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton, were used to prove the necessity of cell-generated tractional forces in blood vessel formation. Our data demonstrate that cell-generated forces not only play a crucial role in the early sprouting stages of capillary morphogenesis but are also required in the later maintenance stages, and thereby suggest a broader interdependence among tissue stiffness, cell contractile forces, and angiogenesis.},

	Abstract = {In vitro models of normal mammary epithelium have correlated increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness with malignant phenotypes. However, the role of increased stiffness in this transformation remains unclear because of difficulties in controlling ECM stiffness, composition and architecture independently. Here we demonstrate that interpenetrating networks of reconstituted basement membrane matrix and alginate can be used to modulate ECM stiffness independently of composition and architecture. We find that, in normal mammary epithelial cells, increasing ECM stiffness alone induces malignant phenotypes but that the effect is completely abrogated when accompanied by an increase in basement-membrane ligands. We also find that the combination of stiffness and composition is sensed through β4 integrin, Rac1, and the PI3K pathway, and suggest a mechanism in which an increase in ECM stiffness, without an increase in basement membrane ligands, prevents normal α6β4 integrin clustering into hemidesmosomes.},

	Abstract = {Extracellular matrix composition and stiffness are known to be critical determinants of cell behavior, modulating processes including differentiation, traction generation, and migration. Recent studies have demonstrated that the ECM composition can modulate how cells migrate in response to gradients in environmental stiffness, altering a cell's ability to undergo durotaxis. These observations were limited to single varieties of extracellular matrix, and typically cells are exposed to environments containing complex mixtures of extracellular matrix proteins. Here, we investigate migration of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on mechanical gradients coated with one or more type of extracellular matrix protein. Our results show that NIH 3T3 fibroblasts exhibit durotaxis on fibronectin-coated mechanical gradients but not on those coated with laminin, demonstrating that extracellular matrix type can act as a regulator of cell response to mechanical gradients. Interestingly, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were also observed to migrate randomly on gradients coated with a mixture of both fibronectin and laminin, suggesting that there may be a complex interplay in the cellular response to mechanical gradients in the presence of multiple extracellular matrix signals. These findings indicate that specific composition of available adhesion ligands is a critical determinant of a cell's migratory response to mechanical gradients.},

@article{Yang2010Mithramycin-inh,
	Abstract = {Mithramycin is an inhibitor of the binding of the Sp-family transcription factor to the GC box. Many studies show that mithramycin may reduce the expression of many oncogenes by inhibiting the mRNA and protein synthesis and it has been used as an antibiotic chemotherapy drug for a long time. Recently, Eps8 (EGFR pathway substrate 8) has been revealed to be a novel proto-oncogene related to cellular transformation, Rac activation and actin barbed-end-capping activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify whether Eps8 might be regulated by mithramycin. Results showed that mithramycin could reduce the mRNA and protein levels of Eps8 in dose- and time-dependent manners in several cancer cell lines. Furthermore, cell growth and migration ability were also reduced significantly by mithramycin treatment. Since Src is a well-known Eps8 activity enhancer, a v-Src transfected IV5 cell line was subjected to mithramycin treatment and then analyzed to show that Src expression was unable to restore the mithramycin-induced decrease in Eps8 expression, cell growth, and migration ability. To further confirm the above mentioned results, the expression of Eps8 was eliminated by a transient transfection with siRNA and subsequent analysis showed that silencing of Eps8 might also lead to a reduced growth and migration ability of cancer cells. These findings suggested that Eps8 was involved in the regulation of growth and motility of cancer cells and mithramycin might exert its anticancer ability via a pathway involving the downregulation of Eps8.},

@article{Reynolds2012Targeted-gene-d,
	Abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a fatal disease despite modern pharmacotherapy. Mutations in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) lead to reduced BMPR2 expression, which is causally linked to PAH. BMPR2 is predominantly expressed on pulmonary endothelium and has complex interactions with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling mechanisms. Our objectives were to assess the effect on PAH of upregulating BMPR2 by targeted adenoviral BMPR2 gene delivery to the pulmonary vascular endothelium. We used two established rat models of PAH: chronic hypoxia and monocrotaline (MCT). In both hypertensive models, those receiving BMPR2 had less right ventricular hypertrophy, less pulmonary vascular resistance, improved cardiac function and reduced vascular remodelling. In the MCT model, there was an increase in TGF-β, which was prevented by BMPR2 treatment. In vitro, TGF-β1-induced endothelial{\textendash}mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, which was associated with reduced BMPR2 expression. EndMT was partially ameliorated by stimulating BMPR2 signalling with appropriate ligands even in the ongoing presence of TGF-β1. Collectively, these results indicate therapeutic potential for upregulation of the BMPR2 axis in PAH, which may be, in part, mediated by countering the remodelling effects of TGF-β.},

Although a considerable amount of markers and signals involved in this process have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the coalescence of angioblasts into this reticular pattern remain unclear. Various recent studies hypothesize that autocrine regulation of the chemoattractant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible for the formation of vascular networks in vitro. However, the autocrine regulation hypothesis does not fit well with reported data on in vivo early vascular development. In this study, we propose a mathematical model based on the alternative assumption that endodermal VEGF signalling activity, having a paracrine effect on adjacent angioblasts, is mediated by its binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Detailed morphometric analysis of simulated networks and images obtained from in vivo quail embryos reveals the model mimics the vascular patterns with high accuracy. These results show that paracrine signalling can result in the formation of fine-grained cellular networks when mediated by angioblast-produced ECM. This lends additional support to the theory that patterning during early vascular development in the vertebrate embryo is regulated by paracrine signalling.},

@article{Nathan2007Idiopathic-Pulm,
	Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has a poor prognosis and a course that is unpredictable. Pulmonary hypertension may complicate the course of IPF and potentially impact prognosis. There are multiple factors that might influence the onset and severity of pulmonary hypertension in IPF. The relationship between the physiologic and pathobiologic manifestations of the progressive fibrotic process and interceding pulmonary hypertension has not been well defined. This article serves to explore these relationships and to hypothesize about the possible linkage between these entities. From a prognostic standpoint, recent evidence suggests this to be important to assess for pulmonary hypertension in patients with IPF. The appropriate triggers for evaluating for pulmonary hypertension and the best method of detection require further study. Despite the relative ease of noninvasive methods, such as echocardiography, right-heart catheterization remains the best diagnostic test. The appeal of pulmonary hypertension in IPF is that it may be an enticing therapeutic target in a disease that otherwise does not have any proven effective therapies. Which agent(s) might be useful and when they should be implemented mandate the appropriate studies being performed. Some of the data presented in this article have previously been reported in abstract form only.},

@article{Farkas2011Pulmonary-Hyper,
	Abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disabling disease of the lung parenchyma, characterized by progressive accumulation of scar tissue and myofibroblast activation after repetitive epithelial microinjury. The therapeutic options are limited, and patients usually die within a few years after diagnosis. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in IPF has been increasingly recognized as a condition with relevance for the overall prognosis. Treatment trials are being designed, but to be effective, it is crucial to better understand the pathobiology of PH in IPF: the traditional concept, that hypoxic vasoconstriction and accumulation of scar tissue are mainly responsible for the development of PH in IPF, has been challenged. Recent studies, including our own in vivo research, suggest that the underlying pathobiology is much more complex, and includes a complicated interaction of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and vascular cells. This interaction seems to be regulated by a large variety of angiogenesis promoters and inhibitors, as well as growth factors. Central components seem to be endothelial apoptosis and growth factor--induced remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall. The present review gives a conceptual overview about known and putative mechanisms that are involved in the development of PH in IPF. This report summarizes currently available therapeutic options, and also translates experimental research to discuss potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies derived from new concepts in pathogenesis.},

@article{Umesh2011Alteration-of-P,
	Abstract = {<i>Background:</i> Pulmonary hypertension is associated with vascular remodeling and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. While the contribution of ECM in vascular remodeling is well documented, the roles played by their receptors, integrins, in pulmonary hypertension have received little attention. Here we characterized the changes of integrin expression in endothelium-denuded pulmonary arteries (PAs) and aorta of chronic hypoxia as well as monocrotaline-treated rats. <i>Methods and Results:</i> Immunoblot showed increased α$_{1}$-, α$_{8}$- and α$_{v}$-integrins, and decreased α$_{5}$-integrin levels in PAs of both models. β$_{1}$- and β$_{3}$-integrins were reduced in PAs of chronic hypoxia and monocrotaline-treated rats, respectively. Integrin expression in aorta was minimally affected. Differential expression of α$_{1}$- and α$_{5}$-integrins induced by chronic hypoxia was further examined. Immunostaining showed that they were expressed on the surface of PA smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), and their distribution was unaltered by chronic hypoxia. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase was augmented in PAs of chronic hypoxia rats, and in chronic hypoxia PASMCs cultured on the α$_{1}$-ligand collagen IV. Moreover, α$_{1}$-integrin binding hexapeptide GRGDTP elicited an enhanced Ca$^{2+}$ response, whereas the response to α$_{5}$-integrin binding peptide GRGDNP was reduced in CH-PASMCs. <i>Conclusion:</i> Integrins in PASMCs are differentially regulated in pulmonary hypertension, and the dynamic integrin-ECM interactions may contribute to the vascular remodeling accompanying disease progression.},

	N2 = {Wound healing is a process driven by cells. The ability of cells to sense mechanical stimuli from the extracellular matrix that surrounds them is used to regulate the forces that cells exert on the tissue. Stresses exerted by cells play a central role in wound contraction and have been broadly modelled. Traditionally, these stresses are assumed to be dependent on variables such as the extracellular matrix and cell or collagen densities. However, we postulate that cells are able to regulate the healing process through a mechanosensing mechanism regulated by the contraction that they exert. We propose that cells adjust the contraction level to determine the tissue functions regulating all main activities, such as proliferation, differentiation and matrix production. Hence, a closed-regulatory feedback loop is proposed between contraction and tissue formation. The model consists of a system of partial differential equations that simulates the evolution of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen and a generic growth factor, as well as the deformation of the extracellular matrix. This model is able to predict the wound healing outcome without requiring the addition of phenomenological laws to describe the time-dependent contraction evolution. We have reproduced two in vivo experiments to evaluate the predictive capacity of the model, and we conclude that there is feedback between the level of cell contraction and the tissue regenerated in the wound.},

@article{Peirce2008Computational-a,
	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, a number of mathematical and computational models have been developed to study different aspects of angiogenesis that span the spatial and temporal scales encompassed by this complex process. For example, models have been built to investigate how growth factors and receptors signal endothelial cell proliferation, how groups of endothelial cells assemble into individual vessels, and how tumors recruit the ingrowth of whole microvascular networks. A prudent question to pose is: ``what have we learned from these models?''This review aims to answer this question as it pertains to angiogenesis in the context of normal physiological growth, tumorigenesis, wound healing, tissue engineering, and the design of therapeutic strategies. We also provide a framework for parsing angiogenesis models into categories, according to the type of modeling approach used, the spatial and temporal scales simulated, and the overarching question being posed to the model. Finally, this review introduces some of the simplification strategies and assumptions used in model building, discusses model validation, and makes recommendations for application of modeling approaches to unresolved questions in the field.},

	Abstract = {Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis. Whereas several feedback loops have been shown to regulate EMT, it remains elusive how they coordinately modulate EMT response to TGF-beta treatment. We construct a mathematical model for the core regulatory network controlling TGF-beta-induced EMT. Through deterministic analyses and stochastic simulations, we show that EMT is a sequential two-step program in which an epithelial cell first is converted to partial EMT then to the mesenchymal state, depending on the strength and duration of TGF-beta stimulation. Mechanistically the system is governed by coupled reversible and irreversible bistable switches. The SNAIL1/miR-34 double-negative feedback loop is responsible for the reversible switch and regulates the initiation of EMT, whereas the ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop is accountable for the irreversible switch and controls the establishment of the mesenchymal state. Furthermore, an autocrine TGF-beta/miR-200 feedback loop makes the second switch irreversible, modulating the maintenance of EMT. Such coupled bistable switches are robust to parameter variation and molecular noise. We provide a mechanistic explanation on multiple experimental observations. The model makes several explicit predictions on hysteretic dynamic behaviors, system response to pulsed stimulation, and various perturbations, which can be straightforwardly tested.},

@article{Gilde2016Stiffness-depen,
	Abstract = {Surface coatings delivering BMP are a promising approach to render biomaterials osteoinductive. In contrast to soluble BMPs which can interact with their receptors at the dorsal side of the cell, BMPs presented as insoluble cue physically bound to a biomimetic matrix, called here matrix-bound (bBMP-2), are presented to cells by their ventral side. To date, BMP-2 internalization and signaling studies in cell biology have always been performed by adding soluble (sBMP-2) to cells adhered on cell culture plates or glass slides, which will be considered here as a ``reference''condition. However, whether and how matrix-bound BMP-2 can be internalized by cells and its relation to canonical (SMAD) and non-canonical signaling (ALP) remain open questions. In this study, we investigated the uptake and processing of BMP-2 by C2C12 myoblasts. This BMP-2 was presented either embedded in polyelectrolyte multilayer films (matrix-bound presentation) or as soluble form. Using fluorescently-labeled BMP-2, we showed that the amount of matrix-bound BMP-2 internalized is dependent on the level of crosslinking of the polyelectrolyte films. Cav-1-mediated internalization is related to both SMAD and ALP signaling, while clathrin-mediated is only related to ALP signaling. BMP-2 internalization was independent on the presentation mode (sBMP-2 versus bBMP-2) for low crosslinked films (soft, EDC10) in striking contrast to high crosslinked (stiff, EDC70) films where internalization was much lower and slower for bBMP-2. As anticipated, internalization of sBMP-2 barely depended on the underlying matrix. Taken together, these results indicate that BMP-2 internalization can be tuned by the underlying matrix and activates downstream BMP-2 signaling, which is key for the effective formation of bone tissue.},

	Abstract = {Fibrosis is a scarring process that is a common feature of chronic organ injury. It is characterized by elevated activity of transforming growth factor-beta resulting in increased and altered deposition of extracellular matrix and other fibrosis-associated proteins. Recent work has demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein-7 blocks transforming growth factor-beta signaling. Moreover, member of the CCN family, Endoglin, Sclerostin, Sclerostin domain-containing proteins, Gremlin, Noggin, Chordin, and Kielin/Chordin-like protein influence the biological activity of both cytokines. As a consequence, they modulate cellular proliferation, migration, adhesion and extracellular matrix production. This tight protein network consisting of transforming growth factor-betas, bone morphogenetic proteins and various binding partners includes potential novel molecular targets and biomarkers useful for prognostication, disease monitoring and therapy. We here summarize recent advances in understanding bone morphogenetic protein-7 function and signaling and the current attempts to use this critical modulator as a pharmacological device to reverse transforming growth factor-beta-induced fibrogenesis.},

	Abstract = {{Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is thought to be triggered by an
   alloreactive response to the donor coronary vasculature, resulting in
   smooth muscle cell proliferation and ultimate occlusion of the donor
   coronary arteries. To determine whether allogeneic lymphocytes are
   capable of regulating endothelial-derived smooth muscle cell (SMC)
   growth factors, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were exposed to
   allogeneic lymphocytes. The HAEC-lymphocyte co-cultures were assessed
   for (a) lymphocyte proliferation in response to the allogeneic HAECs;
   (b) release of soluble factors that stimulate human aortic SMC
   proliferation; and (c) alteration of HAEC mRNA levels for a panel of
   known SMC growth factors. Co-culture conditioned medium increased SMC
   proliferation, compared to medium conditioned by HAECs alone. HAECs
   exposed to allogeneic lymphocytes increased their expression of mRNA for
   basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factors alpha and
   beta, and platelet derived growth factor A and B chains. These results
   demonstrate that allogeneic lymphocytes are capable of inducing HAECs to
   increase mRNA levels for several mesenchymal growth factors and to
   release bioactive products capable of stimulating SMC cell proliferation
   in vitro. Additionally, the data support the hypothesis that
   alloreactive lymphocytes can stimulate allogeneic donor endothelial
   cells to produce growth factors that may contribute to the intimal

@article{Meng2016TGF-beta:-the-m,
	Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is the primary factor that
   drives fibrosis in most, if not all, forms of chronic kidney disease
   (CKD). Inhibition of the TGF-beta isoform, TGF-beta 1, or its downstream
   signalling pathways substantially limits renal fibrosis in a wide range
   of disease models whereas overexpression of TGF-beta 1 induces renal
   fibrosis. TGF-beta 1 can induce renal fibrosis via activation of both
   canonical (Smad-based) and non-canonical (non-Smad-based) signalling
   pathways, which result in activation of myofibroblasts, excessive
   production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and inhibition of ECM
   degradation. The role of Smad proteins in the regulation of fibrosis is
   complex, with competing profibrotic and antifibrotic actions (including
   in the regulation of mesenchymal transitioning), and with complex
   interplay between TGF-beta/Smads and other signalling pathways. Studies
   over the past 5 years have identified additional mechanisms that
   regulate the action of TGF-beta 1/Smad signalling in fibrosis, including
   short and long noncoding RNA molecules and epigenetic modifications of
   DNA and histone proteins. Although direct targeting of TGF-beta 1 is
   unlikely to yield a viable antifibrotic therapy due to the involvement
   of TGF-beta 1 in other processes, greater understanding of the various
   pathways by which TGF-beta 1 controls fibrosis has identified
   alternative targets for the development of novel therapeutics to halt
   this most damaging process in CKD.}},

	Abstract = {The vascular system is locally specialized to accommodate widely varying blood flow and pressure and the distinct needs of individual tissues. The endothelial cells (ECs) that line the lumens of blood and lymphatic vessels play an integral role in the regional specialization of vascular structure and physiology. However, our understanding of EC diversity is limited. To explore EC specialization on a global scale, we used DNA microarrays to determine the expression profile of 53 cultured ECs. We found that ECs from different blood vessels and microvascular ECs from different tissues have distinct and characteristic gene expression profiles. Pervasive differences in gene expression patterns distinguish the ECs of large vessels from microvascular ECs. We identified groups of genes characteristic of arterial and venous endothelium. Hey2, the human homologue of the zebrafish gene gridlock, was selectively expressed in arterial ECs and induced the expression of several arterial-specific genes. Several genes critical in the establishment of left/right asymmetry were expressed preferentially in venous ECs, suggesting coordination between vascular differentiation and body plan development. Tissue-specific expression patterns in different tissue microvascular ECs suggest they are distinct differentiated cell types that play roles in the local physiology of their respective organs and tissues.},

@article{Zeisberg2007Discovery-of-En,
	Abstract = {Activated fibroblasts are associated with many different tumors. Myofibroblasts, activated fibroblasts, and perivascular mesenchymal cells such as pericytes play a role in cancer progression. Many studies suggest that myofibroblasts facilitate tumor growth and cancer progression. The source for myofibroblasts and other activated fibroblasts within the tumors is still debated. Although de novo activation of quiescent fibroblasts into α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA){\textendash}positive myofibroblasts is one likely source, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and bone marrow recruitment are also evolving as possible mechanisms for the emergence of a heterogeneous population of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Here, we show that transforming growth factor-β1 could induce proliferating endothelial cells to undergo a phenotypic conversion into fibroblast-like cells. Such endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is associated with the emergence of mesenchymal marker fibroblast-specific protein-1 (FSP1) and down-regulation of CD31/PECAM. Additionally, we show EndMT in tumors using the B16F10 melanoma model and the Rip-Tag2 spontaneous pancreatic carcinoma model. Crossing Tie2-Cre mice with R26Rosa-lox-Stop-lox-LacZ mice allows for irreversible tagging of endothelial cells. We provide unequivocal evidence for EndMT at the invasive front of the tumors in these transgenic mice. Collectively, our results show that EndMT is a unique mechanism for the accumulation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and suggest that antiangiogenic treatment of tumors may have a direct effect in decreasing activated fibroblasts that likely facilitate cancer progression.

	Abstract = {Myocardin gene has been identified as a master regulator of smooth muscle cell differentiation. Smooth muscle cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) and pulmonary vascular remodelling (PVR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the change of myocardin gene expression in the pulmonary vessels of hypoxia-induced PH affected by Sildenafil treatment and the involvement of endothelial cells transdifferentiation into smooth muscle cells in the process of hypoxia-induced PH and PVR. Myocardin and relative markers were investigated in animal models and cultured endothelial cells. Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was measured. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to show the expression of smooth muscle α-actin (SMA), in situ hybridization (ISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed respectively to detect the myocardin and SMA expression at mRNA levels. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced suppression of myocardin in cultured cells. We confirmed that hypoxia induced the PH and PVR in rats. Sildenafil could attenuate the hypoxia-induced PH. We found that myocardin mRNA expression is upregulated significantly in the hypoxic pulmonary vessels and cultured cells but downregulated in PH with Sildenafil treatment. The porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) transdifferentiate into smooth muscle-like cells in hypoxic culture while the transdifferentiation did not occur when SiRNA of myocardin was applied. Our results suggest that myocardin gene, as a marker of smooth muscle cell differentiation, was expressed in the pulmonary vessels in hypoxia-induced PH rats, which could be downregulated by Sildenafil treatment, as well as in hypoxic cultured endothelial cells. Hypoxia induced the transdifferentiation of endothelial cells of vessels into smooth muscle-like cells which was regulated by myocardin.},

@article{Barrientos2008PERSPECTIVE-ART,
	Abstract = {Wound healing is an evolutionarily conserved, complex, multicellular process that, in skin, aims at barrier restoration. This process involves the coordinated efforts of several cell types including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets. The migration, infiltration, proliferation, and differentiation of these cells will culminate in an inflammatory response, the formation of new tissue and ultimately wound closure. This complex process is executed and regulated by an equally complex signaling network involving numerous growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Of particular importance is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), interleukin (IL) family, and tumor nerosis factor-αfamily. Currently, patients are treated by three growth factors: PDGF-BB, bFGF, and GM-CSF. Only PDGF-BB has successfully completed randomized clinical trials in the Unites States. With gene therapy now in clinical trial and the discovery of biodegradable polymers, fibrin mesh, and human collagen serving as potential delivery systems other growth factors may soon be available to patients. This review will focus on the specific roles of these growth factors and cytokines during the wound healing process.},

	Abstract = {The transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells, a process known as epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT), is integral in development, wound healing and stem cell behaviour, and contributes pathologically to fibrosis and cancer progression. This switch in cell differentiation and behaviour is mediated by key transcription factors, including SNAIL, zinc-finger E-box-binding (ZEB) and basic helix--loop--helix transcription factors, the functions of which are finely regulated at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. The reprogramming of gene expression during EMT, as well as non-transcriptional changes, are initiated and controlled by signalling pathways that respond to extracellular cues. Among these, transforming growth factor-{$[$}beta{$]$} (TGF{$[$}beta{$]$}) family signalling has a predominant role; however, the convergence of signalling pathways is essential for EMT.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the pathobiology of severe pulmonary hypertension, usually a fatal disease, has been hampered by the lack of information of its natural history. We have demonstrated that, in human severe pulmonary hypertension, the precapillary pulmonary arteries show occlusion by proliferated endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) are involved in proper maintenance, differentiation, and function of endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that VEGFR-2 blockade with SU5416 in combination with chronic hypobaric hypoxia causes severe pulmonary hypertension associated with precapillary arterial occlusion by proliferating endothelial cells. Prior to and concomitant with the development of severe pulmonary hypertension, lungs of chronically hypoxic SU5416-treated rats show significant pulmonary endothelial cell death, as demonstrated by activated caspase 3 immunostaining and TUNEL. The broad caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-CH2-DCB prevents the development of intravascular pulmonary endothelial cell growth and severe pulmonary hypertension caused by the combination of SU5416 and chronic hypoxia.---Taraseviciene-Stewart, L., Kasahara, Y., Alger, L., Hirth, P., McMahon, G., Waltenberger, J., Voelkel, N.

	Abstract = {Inflammation and altered immunity are recognized components of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in human patients and in animal models of PAH. While eicosanoid metabolites of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways have been identified in the lungs from pulmonary hypertensive animals their role in the pathogenesis of severe angioobliterative PAH has not been examined. Here we investigated whether a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor or diethylcarbamazine (DEC), that is known for its 5-lipoxygenase inhibiting and antioxidant actions, modify the development of PAH in the Sugen 5416/hypoxia (SuHx) rat model. The COX-2 inhibitor SC-58125 had little effect on the right ventricular pressure and did not prevent the development of pulmonary angioobliteration. In contrast, DEC blunted the muscularization of pulmonary arterioles and reduced the number of fully obliterated lung vessels. DEC treatment of SuHx rats, after the lung vascular disease had been established, reduced the degree of PAH, the number of obliterated arterioles and the degree of perivascular inflammation. We conclude that the non-specific anti-inflammatory drug DEC affects developing PAH and is partially effective once angioobliterative PAH has been established.},

	Abstract = {Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology; its epidemiology in the United States has not been well characterized. Objective: To estimate the annual incidence and prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the United States. Methods: Retrospective cohort design utilizing a large health care claims database spanning the period January 1996 through December 2000. Measurements and Main Results: Persons with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were identified based on diagnosis and procedure codes. Using broad case-finding criteria, prevalence was estimated to range from 4.0 per 100,000 persons aged 18 to 34 yr to 227.2 per 100,000 among those 75 yr or older; annual incidence was estimated to range from 1.2 to 76.4 per 100,000. Using narrow case-finding criteria, prevalence ranged from 0.8 to 64.7 per 100,000 persons; comparable figures for incidence were 0.4 to 27.1 per 100,000 persons. Extrapolating these rates to the overall United States' population, prevalence was estimated to be 42.7 per 100,000 (incidence, 16.3 per 100,000) using broad criteria; with narrow criteria, prevalence was estimated to be 14.0 per 100,000 (incidence, 6.8 per 100,000). Conclusions: Our results suggest that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is probably more common in the United States than previously reported.},

@article{Wagenseil2009Vascular-Extrac,
	Abstract = {An important factor in the transition from an open to a closed circulatory system was a change in vessel wall structure and composition that enabled the large arteries to store and release energy during the cardiac cycle. The component of the arterial wall in vertebrates that accounts for these properties is the elastic fiber network organized by medial smooth muscle. Beginning with the onset of pulsatile blood flow in the developing aorta, smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall produce a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) that will ultimately define the mechanical properties that are critical for proper function of the adult vascular system. This review discusses the structural ECM proteins in the vertebrate aortic wall and will explore how the choice of ECM components has changed through evolution as the cardiovascular system became more advanced and pulse pressure increased. By correlating vessel mechanics with physiological blood pressure across animal species and in mice with altered vessel compliance, we show that cardiac and vascular development are physiologically coupled, and we provide evidence for a universal elastic modulus that controls the parameters of ECM deposition in vessel wall development. We also discuss mechanical models that can be used to design better tissue-engineered vessels and to test the efficacy of clinical treatments.},

	Abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and its ligands serve as a switchboard for the regulation of multiple cellular processes. While it is clear that EGFR activity is essential for normal cardiac development, its function in the vasculature and its role in cardiovascular disease are only beginning to be elucidated. In the blood vessel, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are both a source and a target of EGF-like ligands. Activation of EGFR has been implicated in blood pressure regulation, endothelial dysfunction, neointimal hyperplasia, atherogenesis, and cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, increased circulating EGF-like ligands may mediate accelerated vascular disease associated with chronic inflammation. Although EGFR inhibitors are currently being used clinically for the treatment of cancer, additional studies are necessary to determine whether abrogation of EGFR signaling is a potential strategy for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.},

@article{JimenezEndothelial-to-,
	Abstract = {Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of skin and multiple internal organs and severe functional and structural microvascular alterations. SSc is considered to be the prototypic systemic fibrotic disorder. Despite currently available therapeutic approaches SSc has a high mortality rate owing to the development of SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), complications that have emerged as the most frequent causes of disability and mortality in SSc. The pathogenesis of the fibrotic process in SSc is complex and despite extensive investigation the exact mechanisms have remained elusive. Myofibroblasts are the cells ultimately responsible for tissue fibrosis and fibroproliferative vasculopathy in SSc. Tissue myofibroblasts in SSc originate from several sources including expansion of quiescent tissue fibroblasts and tissue accumulation of CD34 + fibrocytes. Besides these sources, myofibroblasts in SSc may result from the phenotypic conversion of endothelial cells into activated myofibroblasts, a process known as endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Recently, it has been postulated that EndoMT may play a role in the development of SSc-associated ILD and PAH. However, although several studies have described the occurrence of EndoMT in experimentally induced cardiac, renal, and pulmonary fibrosis and in several human disorders, the contribution of EndoMT to SSc-associated ILD and PAH has not been generally accepted. Here, the experimental evidence supporting the concept that EndoMT plays a role in the pathogenesis of SSc-associated ILD and PAH will be reviewed.},

@article{Good2015Endothelial-to-,
	Abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease characterized by lung endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular remodeling. Normally, the endothelium forms an integral cellular barrier to regulate vascular homeostasis. During embryogenesis endothelial cells exhibit substantial plasticity that contribute to cardiac development by undergoing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). We determined the presence of EndoMT in the pulmonary vasculature in vivo and the functional effects on pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) undergoing EndoMT in vitro. Histologic assessment of patients with systemic sclerosis-associated PAH and the hypoxia/SU5416 mouse model identified the presence von Willebrand factor/α-smooth muscle actin--positive endothelial cells in up to 5{\%} of pulmonary vessels. Induced EndoMT in PAECs by inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, and transforming growth factor βled to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the development of a mesenchymal morphology. Induced EndoMT cells exhibited up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, including collagen type I and α-smooth muscle actin, and a reduction in endothelial cell and junctional proteins, including von Willebrand factor, CD31, occludin, and vascular endothelial-cadherin. Induced EndoMT monolayers failed to form viable biological barriers and induced enhanced leak in co-culture with PAECs. Induced EndoMT cells secreted significantly elevated proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor α, and supported higher immune transendothelial migration compared with PAECs. These findings suggest that EndoMT may contribute to the development of PAH.},

The capacity of G protein--coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, such as angiotensin II (AngII), to promote EGFR signaling is called transactivation and is well described, yet delineating the molecular processes and functional relevance of this crosstalk has been challenging. Moreover, these critical findings are dispersed among many different fields. The aim of our review is to highlight recent advancements in defining the signaling cascades and downstream consequences of EGFR transactivation in the cardiovascular renal system. We also focus on studies that link EGFR transactivation to animal models of the disease, and we discuss potential therapeutic applications.},

	Abstract = {During embryonic development, cardiac valves arise at specific regions in the cardiac endothelium that swell up due to enhanced extracellular matrix production (so-called endocardial cushions). An important extracellular matrix component that is produced by the endocardial cells is the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. A deficiency in hyaluronan synthesis results in a failure to form endocardial cushions and a loss of their cellularization by a process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. Expression of the major hyaluronan synthase Has2 is under the influence of both positive and negative regulators. MicroRNA-dependent degradation of Has2 is required to control extracellular hyaluronan levels and thereby the size of the endocardial cushions. In this article, we review the current literature on hyaluronan synthesis during cardiac valve formation and propose that a balanced activity of both positive and negative regulators is required to maintain the critical homeostasis of hyaluronan levels in the extracellular matrix and thereby the size of the endocardial cushions. The activating and inhibitory interactions between microRNA-23, Has2, and hyaluronan are reminiscent of a reaction--diffusion system. Using a mathematical modeling approach we show that the system can produce a confined expression of hyaluronan, but only if the inhibitory signal is transferred to adjacent cells in exosomes.},

	N2 = {Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins are critical regulators of angiogenesis. VEGF concentration gradients are important for activation and chemotactic guidance of capillary sprouting, but measurement of these gradients in vivo is not currently possible. We have constructed a biophysically and molecularly detailed computational model to study microenvironmental transport of two isoforms of VEGF in rat extensor digitorum longus skeletal muscle under in vivo conditions. Using parameters based on experimental measurements, the model includes: VEGF secretion from muscle fibers; binding to the extracellular matrix; binding to and activation of endothelial cell surface VEGF receptors; and internalization. For 2-D cross sections of tissue, we analyzed predicted VEGF distributions, gradients, and receptor binding. Significant VEGF gradients (up to 12{\%} change in VEGF concentration over 10 μm) were predicted in resting skeletal muscle with uniform VEGF secretion, due to non-uniform capillary distribution. These relative VEGF gradients were not sensitive to extracellular matrix composition, or to the overall VEGF expression level, but were dependent on VEGF receptor density and affinity, and internalization rate parameters. VEGF upregulation in a subset of fibers increased VEGF gradients, simulating transplantation of pro-angiogenic myoblasts, a possible therapy for ischemic diseases. The number and relative position of overexpressing fibers determined the VEGF gradients and distribution of VEGF receptor activation. With total VEGF expression level in the tissue unchanged, concentrating overexpression into a small number of adjacent fibers can increase the number of capillaries activated. The VEGF concentration gradients predicted for resting muscle (average 3{\%} VEGF/10 μm) is sufficient for cellular sensing; the tip cell of a vessel sprout is approximately 50 μm long. The VEGF gradients also result in heterogeneity in the activation of blood vessel VEGF receptors. This first model of VEGF tissue transport and heterogeneity provides a platform for the design and evaluation of therapeutic approaches.},

Computational models are increasingly used as a tool to identify potential mechanisms driving a phenotype or potential therapeutic targets against an unwanted phenotype. Here we review how computational models incorporating cardiac fibroblasts have clarified the role for these cells in electrical conduction and tissue remodeling in the heart. Models of fibroblast signaling networks have primarily focused on fibroblast cell lines or fibroblasts from other tissues rather than cardiac fibroblasts, specifically, but they are useful for understanding how fundamental signaling pathways control fibroblast phenotype. In the future, modeling cardiac fibroblast signaling, incorporating -omics and drug-interaction data into signaling network models, and utilizing multi-scale models will improve the ability of in silico studies to predict potential therapeutic targets against adverse cardiac fibroblast activity.},

@article{Steinway2015Combinatorial-i,
	Abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process hijacked by cancer cells to leave the primary tumor site, invade surrounding tissue and establish distant metastases. A hallmark of EMT is the loss of E-cadherin expression, and one major signal for the induction of EMT is transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), which is dysregulated in up to 40% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to identify network perturbations that suppress TGFβ-driven EMT, with the goal of suppressing invasive properties of cancer cells. We use a systems-level Boolean dynamic model of EMT to systematically screen individual and combination perturbations (inhibition or constitutive activation of up to four nodes). We use a recently developed network control approach to understand the mechanism through which the combinatorial interventions suppress EMT. We test the results of our in silico analysis using siRNA. Our model predicts that targeting key elements of feedback loops in combination with the SMAD complex is more effective than suppressing the SMAD complex alone. We demonstrate experimentally that expression of a majority of these elements is enriched in mesenchymal relative to epithelial phenotype HCC cell lines. An siRNA screen of the predicted combinations confirms that many targeting strategies suppress TGFβ-driven EMT measured by E-cadherin expression and cell migration. Our analysis reveals that some perturbations give rise to hybrid states intermediate to the epithelial and mesenchymal states. Our results indicate that EMT is driven by an interconnected signaling network and many apparently successful single interventions may lead to steady states that are in-between epithelial and mesenchymal states. As these putative hybrid or partial EMT states may retain invasive properties, our results suggest that combinatorial therapies are necessary to fully suppress invasive properties of tumor cells.},

	Abstract = {To address questions concerning why and how the morphology of endothelial cells (ECs) forms under shear stress loading, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) three-dimensional (3D) model of ECs simulating cell shape was designed. A full 3D non-linear CFD simulation was conducted to estimate the wall shear stress (WSS) distribution. The model cell was capable of random rotation, deformation, migration, and proliferation. Flow was computed after each update of the cell shape with infinitesimal configuration changes. After a finite interval of the flow computation, only the infinitesimal configuration changes that reduced the WSS were allowed to accumulate. As a result of the very long free-run computation experiment, starting with a sub-confluent pattern of cells, the model cells became confluent and were elongated and aligned, with a shape index (SI) very close to that reported for cells in vivo. The average WSS converged to the lowest value at the same time.},

	Abstract = {An epithelial--mesenchymal transformation (EMT) involves alterations in cell--cell and cell--matrix adhesion, the detachment of epithelial cells from their neighbors, the degradation of the basal lamina and acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype. Here we present Monte Carlo simulations for a specific EMT in early heart development: the formation of cardiac cushions. Cell rearrangements are described in accordance with Steinberg's differential adhesion hypothesis, which states that cells possess a type-dependent adhesion apparatus and are sufficiently motile to give rise to the tissue conformation with the largest number of strong bonds. We also implement epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation, cell type change and extracellular matrix production by mesenchymal cells. Our results show that an EMT is promoted more efficiently by an increase in cell--substrate adhesion than by a decrease in cell--cell adhesion. In addition to cushion tissue formation, the model also accounts for the phenomena of matrix invasion and mesenchymal condensation. We conclude that in order to maintain epithelial integrity during EMT the number of epithelial cells must increase at a controlled rate. Our model predictions are in qualitative agreement with available experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Blood vessel development is a vital process during embryonic development, during tissue growth, regeneration and disease processes in the adult. In the past decade researchers have begun to unravel basic molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation of vascular lumen, sprouting angiogenesis, fusion of vessels, and pruning of the vascular plexus. The understanding of the biology of these angiogenic processes is increasingly driven through studies on vascular development at the cellular resolution. Single cell analysis in vivo, advanced genetic tools and the widespread use of powerful animal models combined with improved imaging possibilities are delivering new insights into endothelial cell form, function and behavior angiogenesis. Moreover, the combination of in silico modeling and experimentation including dynamic imaging promotes insights into higher level cooperative behavior leading to functional patterning of vascular networks. Here we summarize recent concepts and advances in the field of vascular development, focusing in detail on the endothelial cell.},

In particular, the smallest vessels --arterioles, venules and capillaries --can be extended, expanded or pruned, in response to exercise, ischaemic events, pharmacological interventions, or other physiological and pathophysiological events. In this review, we describe the multi-step morphogenic process of angiogenesis --the sprouting of new blood vessels --and the stability of vascular networks in vivo. In particular, we review the known interactions between endothelial cells and the various blood cells and plasma components they convey.

	Abstract = {Integrin-mediated cell adhesion is important for development, immune responses, hemostasis and wound healing. Integrins also function as signal transducing receptors that can control intracellular pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and cell fate. Conversely, cells can modulate the affinity of integrins for their ligands a process operationally defined as integrin activation. Analysis of activation of integrins has now provided a detailed molecular understanding of this unique form of ``inside-out''signal transduction and revealed new paradigms of how transmembrane domains (TMD) can transmit long range allosteric changes in transmembrane proteins. Here, we will review how talin and mediates integrin activation and how the integrin TMD can transmit these inside out signals. {$[$}BMB Reports 2014; 47(12): 655-659{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, therapeutic options for tissue fibrosis are severely limited, and organ transplantation is the only effective treatment for end-stage fibrotic disease. However, demand for donor organs greatly outstrips supply, and so effective anti-fibrotic treatments are urgently required. In recent years, the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors has gained prominence as key regulators of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Fibrosis models in multiple organs have demonstrated that integrins have profound effects on the fibrotic process. There is now abundant in vivo data demonstrating critical regulatory roles for integrins expressed on different cell types during tissue fibrogenesis. In this review, we will examine the ways in which integrins regulate these processes and discuss how the manipulation of integrins using function blocking antibodies and small molecule inhibitors may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with a broad range of fibrotic diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Fibrosis: Translation of basic research to human disease.},

@article{Teoh2016Integrins-as-Th,
	Abstract = {Integrins are a large family of transmembrane heterodimeric proteins that constitute the main receptors for extracellular matrix components. Integrins were initially thought to be primarily involved in the maintenance of cell adhesion and tissue integrity. However, it is now appreciated that integrins play important roles in many other biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell shape and polarity. Lung cells express numerous combinations and permutations of integrin heterodimers. The complexity and diversity of different integrin heterodimers being implicated in different lung diseases present a major challenge for drug development. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of integrins from studies in cell culture to integrin knockout mouse models and provide an update of results from clinical trials for which integrins are therapeutic targets with a focus on respiratory diseases (asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis).},

@article{Gualandris2000The-Latent-Tran,
	Abstract = {The latent transforming growth factor-β--binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) belongs to a family of extracellular glycoproteins that includes three additional isoforms (LTBP-2, -3, and -4) and the matrix proteins fibrillin-1 and -2. Originally described as a TGF-β--masking protein, LTBP-1 is involved both in the sequestration of latent TGF-β in the extracellular matrix and the regulation of its activation in the extracellular environment. Whereas the expression of LTBP-1 has been analyzed in normal and malignant cells and rodent and human tissues, little is known about LTBP-1 in embryonic development. To address this question, we used murine embryonic stem (ES) cells to analyze the appearance and role of LTBP-1 during ES cell differentiation. In vitro, ES cells aggregate to form embryoid bodies (EBs), which differentiate into multiple cell lineages. We analyzed LTBP-1 gene expression and LTBP-1 fiber appearance with respect to the emergence and distribution of cell types in differentiating EBs. LTBP-1 expression increased during the first 12 d in culture, appeared to remain constant between d 12 and 24, and declined thereafter. By immunostaining, fibrillar LTBP-1 was observed in those regions of the culture containing endothelial, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells. We found that inclusion of a polyclonal antibody to LTBP-1 during EB differentiation suppressed the expression of the endothelial specific genes ICAM-2 and von Willebrand factor and delayed the organization of differentiated endothelial cells into cord-like structures within the growing EBs. The same effect was observed when cultures were treated with either antibodies to TGF-β or the latency associated peptide, which neutralize TGF-β. Conversely, the organization of endothelial cells was enhanced by incubation with TGF-β1. These results suggest that during differentiation of ES cells LTBP-1 facilitates endothelial cell organization via a TGF-β--dependent mechanism.},

The ECM provides essential physical scaffolding for the cellular constituents, as well as contributes to crucial biochemical signaling. Importantly, ECM is an indispensable part of all biological barriers and substantially modulates the interchange of the nanotechnology products through these barriers. The interactions of the ECM with nanoparticles (NPs) depend on the morphological characteristics of intercellular matrix and on the physical characteristics of the NPs and may be either deleterious or beneficial. Importantly, an altered expression of ECM molecules ultimately affects all biological processes including inflammation. This review critically discusses the specific behavior of NPs that are within the ECM domain, and passing through the biological barriers. Furthermore, regenerative and toxicological aspects of nanomaterials are debated in terms of the immune cells-NPs interactions.},

How the behavior of so many cells is coordinated to produce complex structures is still incompletely understood. Most biomedical research focuses on the molecular signals that cells exchange with one another. It has now become clear that cells also communicate biomechanically during morphogenesis. In cell cultures, endothelial cells---the building blocks of blood vessels---can organize into structures resembling networks of capillaries. Experimental work has shown that the endothelial cells pull onto the protein gel that they live in, called the extracellular matrix. On sufficiently compliant matrices, the strains resulting from these cellular pulling forces slow down and reorient adjacent cells. Here we propose a new computational model to show that this simple form of mechanical cell-cell communication suffices for reproducing the formation of blood vessel-like structures in cell cultures. These findings advance our understanding of biomechanical signaling during morphogenesis, and introduce a new set of computational tools for modeling mechanical interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix.},

@article{Montani2013Pulmonary-arter,
	Abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive disease leading to right heart failure and ultimately death if untreated. The first classification of PH was proposed in 1973. In 2008, the fourth World Symposium on PH held in Dana Point (California, USA) revised previous classifications. Currently, PH is devided into five subgroups. Group 1 includes patients suffering from idiopathic or familial PAH with or without germline mutations. Patients with a diagnosis of PAH should systematically been screened regarding to underlying mutations of BMPR2 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2) or more rarely of ACVRL1 (activine receptor-like kinase type 1), ENG (endogline) or Smad8 genes. Pulmonary veno occusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemagiomatosis are individualized and designated as clinical group 1'. Group 2 'Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart diseases' is divided into three sub-groups: systolic dysfonction, diastolic dysfonction and valvular dysfonction. Group 3 'Pulmonary hypertension due to respiratory diseases' includes a heterogenous subgroup of respiratory diseases like PH due to pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, lung emphysema or interstitial lung disease for exemple. Group 4 includes chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension without any distinction of proximal or distal forms. Group 5 regroup PH patients with unclear multifactorial mechanisms. Invasive hemodynamic assessment with right heart catheterization is requested to confirm the definite diagnosis of PH showing a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥25 mmHg and a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≤15 mmHg. The assessment of PCWP may allow the distinction between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH (PCWP > 15 mmHg). Echocardiography is an important tool in the management of patients with underlying suspicion of PH. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society (ESC-ERS) guidelines specify its role, essentially in the screening proposing criteria for estimating the presence of PH mainly based on tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity and systolic artery pressure (sPAP). The therapy of PAH consists of non-specific drugs including oral anticoagulation and diuretics as well as PAH specific therapy. Diuretics are one of the most important treatment in the setting of PH because right heart failure leads to fluid retention, hepatic congestion, ascites and peripheral edema. Current recommendations propose oral anticoagulation aiming for targeting an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 1.5-2.5. Target INR for patients displaying chronic thromboembolic PH is between 2--3. Better understanding in pathophysiological mechanisms of PH over the past quarter of a century has led to the development of medical therapeutics, even though no cure for PAH exists. Several specific therapeutic agents were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids (epoprostenol, trepoprostenil, iloprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil). This review discusses the current state of art regarding to epidemiologic aspects of PH, diagnostic approaches and the current classification of PH. In addition, currently available specific PAH therapy is discussed as well as future treatments.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) lacks community prevalence and outcome data. OBJECTIVE: To characterise minimum `indicative'prevalences and mortality data for all forms of PHT in a selected population with an elevated estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (ePASP) on echocardiography. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Residents of Armadale and the surrounding region in Western Australia (population 165 450) referred to our unit for transthoracic echocardiography between January 2003 and December 2009. RESULTS: Overall, 10 314 individuals (6.2{\%} of the surrounding population) had 15 633 echo studies performed. Of these, 3320 patients (32{\%}) had insufficient TR to ePASP and 936 individuals (9.1{\%}, 95{\%} CI 8.6{\%} to 9.7{\%}) had PHT, defined as, ePASP>40 mm Hg. The minimum `indicative'prevalence for all forms of PHT is 326 cases/100 000 inhabitants of the local population, with left heart disease-associated PHT being the commonest cause (250 cases/100 000). 15 cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension/100 000 inhabitants were identified and an additional 144 individuals (15{\%}) with no identified cause for their PHT. The mean time to death for those with ePASP >40 mm Hg, calculated from the first recorded ePASP, was 4.1 years (95{\%} CI 3.9 to 4.3). PHT increased mortality whatever the underlying cause, but patients with PHT from left heart disease had the worst prognosis and those with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving disease-specific treatment the best prognosis. Risk of death increased with PHT severity: severe pulmonary hypertension shortened the lifespan by an average of 1.1 years compared with mild pulmonary hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, PHT was common and deadly. Left heart disease was the most common cause and had the worst prognosis and treated pulmonary arterial hypertension had the best prognosis.},

	Abstract = { AbstractBackground:The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) in the US is largely unknown. Prior research has estimated PAH prevalence in Europe at ∼15--52 per million.Methods:Using a privately insured claims database (1999--2007) for the under age 65 population and a Medicare claims database for the 65+ population, and following the current clinical classification of PH, CTEPH patients were identified as having: ≥2 claims for pulmonary hypertension (PH) [ICD-9-CM: 416.0, 416.8]; ≥1 claim for pulmonary embolism (PE) ≤12 months prior or 1 month after the initial PH claim (index date). PAH patients were identified: ≥2 claims for primary PH [416.0]; no left heart disease, lung diseases, CTEPH, or miscellaneous PH diagnoses ≤12 months prior or 1 month after the index date. Both cohorts were required to have ≥1 claim for right heart catheterization ≤6 months prior to any PH claim, or ≥1 claim for echocardiogram ≤6 months prior to a specialist-diagnosed PH claim. Age- and gender-standardized prevalence rates per million individuals (PMI) were calculated using appropriate population weights.Results:Prevalence rates (95\% CI) of CTEPH were estimated at 63 (34--91) PMI among the privately insured (<65), and 1007 (904--1111) PMI among the Medicare population (≥65). The corresponding estimates for PAH were 109 (71--146) PMI among the <65 population, and 451 (384--519) PMI for Medicare.Limitations:Identification of PAH and CTEPH patients in administrative claims data is challenging, due to lack of specific ICD-9-CM codes for the conditions and risk of misdiagnosis.Conclusions:Prevalence rates of CTEPH and PAH increase with age, and are higher among women. The increased risk of PE may explain the sharp age gradient for CTEPH prevalence. The estimated US prevalence of PAH is higher than existing estimates. },

@article{George2014Pulmonary-Hyper,
	Abstract = {Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an uncommon but progressive condition, and much of what we know about it comes from specialized disease registries. With expanding research into the diagnosis and treatment of PH, it is important to provide updated surveillance on the impact of this disease on hospitalizations and mortality. This study, which builds on previous PH surveillance of mortality and hospitalization, analyzed mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey between 2001 and 2010. PH deaths were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes I27.0, I27.2, I27.8, or I27.9 as any contributing cause of death on the death certificate. Hospital discharges associated with PH were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 416.0, 416.8, or 416.9 as one of up to seven listed medical diagnoses. The decline in death rates associated with PH among men from 1980 to 2005 has reversed and now shows a significant increasing trend. Similarly, the death rates for women with PH have continued to increase significantly during the past decade. PH-associated mortality rates for those aged 85 years and older have accelerated compared with rates for younger age groups. There have been significant declines in PH-associated mortality rates for those with pulmonary embolism and emphysema. Rates of hospitalization for PH have increased significantly for both men and women during the past decade; for those aged 85 years and older, hospitalization rates have nearly doubled. Continued surveillance helps us understand and address the evolving trends in hospitalization and mortality associated with PH and PH-associated conditions, especially regarding sex, age, and race/ethnicity disparities.},

@article{Peters2015Umbilical-Cord-,
	Abstract = {Umbilical cord blood represents a promising cell source for pro-angiogenic therapies. The present study examined the potential of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from umbilical cord blood to support endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) microvessel formation. MNCs were isolated from the cord blood of 20 separate donors and selected for further characterization based upon their proliferation potential and morphological resemblance to human vascular pericytes (HVPs). MNCs were screened for their ability to support EPC network formation using an in vitro assay (Matrigel{\texttrademark}) as well as a reductionist, coculture system consisting of no additional angiogenic cytokines beyond those present in serum. In less than 15{\%} of the isolations, we identified a population of highly proliferative MNCs that phenotypically resembled HVPs as assessed by expression of PDGFR-β, NG2, α-SMA, and ephrin-B2. Within a Matrigel{\texttrademark}system, MNCs demonstrated pericyte-like function through colocalization to EPC networks and similar effects as HVPs upon total EPC tubule length (p = 0.95) and number of branch points (p = 0.93). In a reductionist coculture system, MNCs served as pro-angiogenic mural cells by supporting EPC network formation to a significantly greater extent than HVP cocultures, by day 14 of coculture, as evidenced through EPC total tubule length (p <0.0001) and number of branch points (p < 0.0001). Our findings are significant as we demonstrate mural cell progenitors can be isolated from umbilical cord blood and develop culture conditions to support their use in microvascular tissue engineering applications.},

@article{Timmermans2007Endothelial-out,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Two types of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), early EPCs and late EPCs (also called endothelial outgrowth cells [EOCs]), were described in vitro previously. In this report, we dissect the phenotype of the precursor(s) that generate these cell types with focus on the markers CD34, CD133, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) that have been used to identify putative circulating endothelial precursors. We also included CD45 in the analysis to assess the relation between CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors (HPC), CD34+ endothelial precursors, and both in vitro generated EPC types. Addressing this issue might lead to a better understanding of the lineage and phenotype of the precursor(s) that give rise to both cell types in vitro and may contribute to a consensus on their flowcytometric enumeration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using cell sorting of human cord blood (UCB) and bone marrow (BM) cells, we demonstrate that EOC generating precursors are confined to a small CD34+ CD45- cell fraction, but not to the CD34+ CD45+ HPC fraction, nor any other CD45+ subpopulation. CD34+ CD45+ HPC generated monocytic cells that displayed characteristics typical for early EPCs. Phenotypic analysis showed that EOC generating CD34+ CD45- cells express VEGFR2 but not CD133, whereas CD34+ CD45+ HPC express CD133 as expected, but not VEGFR2. CONCLUSION: EOCs are not derived from CD133+ cells or CD45+ hematopoietic precursors.},

It is characterised by cellular and structural changes of the pulmonary arteries causing higher pulmonar vascular resistance and right ventricular failure. Abnormal deposition of smooth muscle-like (SM-like) cells in normally non-muscular, small diameter vessels and a deregulated control of endothelial cells are considered pathological features of PH. The origin of the SM-like cells and the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of this remodelling process are not understood. Endothelial cells within the intima may migrate from their organised layer of cells and transition to mesenchymal or SM-like phenotype in a process called endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EnMT). Traditionally, Waddington's epigenetic landscape illustrates that fates of somatic cells are progressively determined to compulsorily follow a downhill differentiation pathway. EnMT induces the transformation of cells with stem cell traits, therefore contrasting Waddington's theory and confirming that cell fate seems to be far more flexible than previously thought. The prospect of therapeutic inhibition of EnMT to delay or prevent PH may represent a promising new treatment modality.},

@article{Ramos1987Primary-culture,
	Abstract = {Primary cultures of rat vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells were developed as models to study xenobiotic-induced cytotoxicity. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation of rat thoracic aortae. Optimal cell growth and minimal fibroblast contamination in cultures of both cell types were obtained in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultured cells were characterized by distinctive morphologic features and growth patterns. Intercellular endothelial cell junctions were selectively stained with silver nitrate. Endothelial cells also exhibited a nonthrombogenic surface, as reflected by platelet-binding studies. Confluent cultures of smooth muscle cells, but not endothelial cells, contracted in response to norepinephrine (10 microM). Cultures of both cell types were exposed to acrolein (2, 5 or 50 ppm), an environmental pollutant, for 4 and 24 h. Morphologic damage, lactate dehydrogenase release, and cellular thiol content were used as indices of cytotoxicity. Acrolein-induced enzyme leakage and morphologic alterations were dose- and time-dependent and more pronounced in cultures of smooth muscle cells than in endothelial cells. The total thiol content of endothelial cells exposed to acrolein (50 ppm) for 24 h was not significantly different from that of respective controls. In contrast, the content of treated smooth muscle cells was higher than that of controls. These observations show that primary cultures of vascular cells provide a useful model to evaluate xenobiotic-induced cytotoxicity. The information obtained using a cell culture system may be complemented by the use of other in vivo and in vitro models to determine the mechanisms by which xenobiotics cause vascular cell injury.},

@article{Ochoa2008Cyclic-Stretch-,
	Abstract = {Endothelial cells are subjected to mechanical forces in the form of cyclic stretch resulting from blood pulsatility. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) produce factors that stimulate and inhibit pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) growth. We hypothesized that PAECs exposed to cyclic stretch secrete proteins that inhibit PASMC growth. Media from PAECs exposed to cyclic stretch significantly inhibited PASMC growth in a time-dependent manner. Lyophilized material isolated from stretched PAEC-conditioned media significantly inhibited PASMC growth in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was reversed by trypsin inactivation, which is consistent with the relevant factor being a protein(s). To identify proteins that inhibited cell growth in conditioned media from stretched PAECs, we used proteomic techniques and found that thrombospondin (TSP)-1, a natural antiangiogenic factor, was up-regulated by stretch. In vitro, exogenous TSP-1 inhibited PASMC growth. TSP-1--blocking antibodies reversed conditioned media--induced inhibition of PASMC growth. Cyclic stretched PAECs secrete protein(s) that inhibit PASMC proliferation. TSP-1 may be, at least in part, responsible for this inhibition. The complete identification and understanding of the secreted proteome of stretched PAECs may lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of pulmonary vascular remodeling.},

@article{Mahmoud2017Shear-stress-in,
	Abstract = {Blood flow influences atherosclerosis by generating wall shear stress, which alters endothelial cell (EC) physiology. Low shear stress induces dedifferentiation of EC through a process termed endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). The mechanisms underlying shear stress-regulation of EndMT are uncertain. Here we investigated the role of the transcription factor Snail in low shear stress-induced EndMT. Studies of cultured EC exposed to flow revealed that low shear stress induced Snail expression. Using gene silencing it was demonstrated that Snail positively regulated the expression of EndMT markers (Slug, N-cadherin, alpha-SMA) in EC exposed to low shear stress. Gene silencing also revealed that Snail enhanced the permeability of endothelial monolayers to macromolecules by promoting EC proliferation and migration. En face staining of the murine aorta or carotid arteries modified with flow-altering cuffs demonstrated that Snail was expressed preferentially at low shear stress sites that are predisposed to atherosclerosis. Snail was also expressed in EC overlying atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries from patients with ischemic heart disease implying a role in human arterial disease. We conclude that Snail is an essential driver of EndMT under low shear stress conditions and may promote early atherogenesis by enhancing vascular permeability.},

@article{Uhlig2002Ventilation-ind,
	Abstract = {10.1152/ajplung.00124. 2001. The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network clinical trial on ventilation of critically ill patients has drawn attention to the potential side effects of mechanical ventilation. Both clinical and basic research have demonstrated that injurious ventilation strategies can initiate or perpetuate local and systemic inflammatory responses. There are four principal mechanisms that can produce such a response. 1) Ventilation, especially with high ventilation pressures and zero positive end-expiratory pressure, can cause stress failure of the plasma membrane and of epithelial and endothelial barriers. Stress failure of the plasma membrane causes necrosis, which leads to liberation of both preformed inflammatory mediators and agents that stimulate other cells that are still intact to produce such mediators.2) Stress failure of the barriers causes loss of compartmentalization with spread of mediators and bacteria throughout the body as a consequence. 3) Less injurious ventilation strategies that do not cause tissue destruction can elicit release of mediators by more specific mechanisms, presumably through activation of stretch-activated signaling cascades (mechanotransduction).4) Ventilation with increasing positive pressures raises the pressure in the pulmonary circulation and thus vascular shear stress, both of which are known stimuli for endothelial cells. These different mechanisms should be taken into account in the design and the interpretation of studies on molecular mechanisms of ventilation-induced lung injury.},

	Abstract = {Macrophages are endowed with a variety of receptors for lineage-determining growth factors, T helper (Th) cell cytokines, and B cell, host, and microbial products. In tissues, macrophages mature and are activated in a dynamic response to combinations of these stimuli to acquire specialized functional phenotypes. As for the lymphocyte system, a dichotomy has been proposed for macrophage activation: classic vs. alternative, also M1 and M2, respectively. In view of recent research about macrophage functions and the increasing number of immune-relevant ligands, a revision of the model is needed. Here, we assess how cytokines and pathogen signals influence their functional phenotypes and the evidence for M1 and M2 functions and revisit a paradigm initially based on the role of a restricted set of selected ligands in the immune response.},

	Abstract = {Cells of the monocyte--macrophage lineage play a central role in the orchestration and resolution of inflammation. Plasticity is a hallmark of mononuclear phagocytes, and in response to environmental signals these cells undergo different forms of polarized activation, the extremes of which are called classic or M1 and alternative or M2. NF-κB is a key regulator of inflammation and resolution, and its activation is subject to multiple levels of regulation, including inhibitory, which finely tune macrophage functions. Here we identify the p50 subunit of NF-κB as a key regulator of M2-driven inflammatory reactions in vitro and in vivo. p50 NF-κB inhibits NF-κB--driven, M1-polarizing, IFN-β production. Accordingly, p50-deficient mice show exacerbated M1-driven inflammation and defective capacity to mount allergy and helminth-driven M2-polarized inflammatory reactions. Thus, NF-κB p50 is a key component in the orchestration of M2-driven inflammatory reactions.},

	Abstract = {Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. In response to IFNs, Toll-like receptor engagement, or IL-4/IL-13 signaling, macrophages undergo M1 (classical) or M2 (alternative) activation, which represent extremes of a continuum in a universe of activation states. Progress has now been made in defining the signaling pathways, transcriptional networks, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying M1-M2 or M2-like polarized activation. Functional skewing of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in vivo under physiological conditions (e.g., ontogenesis and pregnancy) and in pathology (allergic and chronic inflammation, tissue repair, infection, and cancer). However, in selected preclinical and clinical conditions, coexistence of cells in different activation states and unique or mixed phenotypes have been observed, a reflection of dynamic changes and complex tissue-derived signals. The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with macrophage plasticity and polarized activation provides a basis for macrophage-centered diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.},

@article{Barnes2004Alveolar-Macrop,
	Abstract = {Alveolar macrophages play a critical role in the pathophysiology of COPD and are a major target for future anti-inflammatory therapy. Macrophage numbers are markedly increased in the lung and alveolar space of patients with COPD and are localized to sites of alveolar destruction. The increased numbers of macrophages may result from increased recruitment of blood monocytes, prolonged survival in the lung and to a lesser extent to increased proliferation in the lung. Alveolar macrophages from COPD patients have an increased baseline and stimulated secretion of inflammatory proteins, including certain cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species and elastolytic enzymes, which together could account for all of the pathophysiological features of COPD. Alveolar macrophages form COPD appear to be resistant to the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteriods and this is linked to reduced activity and expression of histone deacetylase 2, a nuclear enzyme that switches off inflammatory genes },

@article{Pappas2013The-role-of-mac,
	Abstract = {Abstract Macrophages are a major cellular component of the innate immune system, and play an important role in the recognition of microbes, particulates, and immunogens and to the regulation of inflammatory responses. In the lung, macrophages react with soluble proteins that bind microbial products in order to remove pathogens and particles and to maintain the sterility of the airway tract. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma are both obstructive airway diseases that involve chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract which contributes to disease progression. In the case of COPD, there is increasing evidence that lung macrophages orchestrate inflammation through the release of chemokines that attract neutrophils, monocytes and T cells and the release of several proteases. On the other hand, in asthma, it seems that alveolar macrophages are inappropriately activated and are implicated in the development and progression of the disease. In this review we summarize the current basic and clinical research studies which highlight the role of macrophages in asthma and COPD.},

	Abstract = {Biologic scaffolds composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) are widely used to facilitate remodeling and reconstruction of a variety of tissues in both preclinical animal studies and human clinical applications. The mechanisms by which such scaffolds influence the host tissue response are only partially understood, but it is logical that the mononuclear macrophage cell population plays a central role. The present study evaluated the role of macrophages that derive from peripheral blood in the degradation of ECM scaffolds. An established rat body wall reconstruction model was used to evaluate the degradation of carbodiimide (CDI)-crosslinked scaffolds composed of porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), noncrosslinked SIS, and autologous body wall. To assess the role of circulating macrophages in the degradation process, the degradation of each scaffold was assessed with and without macrophage depletion caused by administration of clodronate-containing liposomes. Results showed that peripheral blood monocytes are required for the early and rapid degradation of both SIS scaffolds and autologous body wall, and that CDI crosslinked SIS is resistant to macrophage-mediated degradation.},

	Abstract = {The host response to biomaterials is a critical determinant of their success or failure in tissue-repair applications. Macrophages are among the first responders in the host response to biomaterials and have been shown to be predictors of downstream tissue remodeling events. Biomaterials composed of mammalian extracellular matrix (ECM) in particular have been shown to promote distinctive and constructive remodeling outcomes when compared to their synthetic counterparts, a property that has been largely attributed to their ability to modulate the host macrophage response. ECM bioscaffolds are prepared by decellularizing source tissues such as dermis and small intestinal submucosa. The differential ability of such scaffolds to influence macrophage behavior has not been determined. The present study determines the effects of ECM bioscaffolds derived from eight different source tissues upon macrophage surface marker expression, protein content, phagocytic capability, metabolism, and antimicrobial activity. The results show that macrophages exposed to small intestinal submucosa (SIS), urinary bladder matrix (UBM), brain ECM (bECM), esophageal ECM (eECM), and colonic ECM (coECM) express a predominant M2-like macrophage phenotype, which is pro-remodeling and anti-inflammatory (iNOS−/Fizz1+/CD206+). In contrast, macrophage exposure to dermal ECM resulted in a predominant M1-like, pro-inflammatory phenotype (iNOS+/Fizz1−/CD206−), whereas liver ECM (LECM) and skeletal muscle ECM (mECM) did not significantly change the expression of these markers. All solubilized ECM bioscaffold treatments resulted in an increased macrophage antimicrobial activity, but no differences were evident in macrophage phagocytic capabilities, and macrophage metabolism was decreased following exposure to UBM, bECM, mECM, coECM, and dECM. The present work could have important implications when considering the macrophage response following ECM implantation for site-appropriate tissue remodeling. {\copyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = { The observation that macrophages are increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are associated with COPD severity has led to a large number of studies on macrophage function in COPD. These studies have provided evidence that these cells contribute to tissue injury through the release of various mediators, including proteases such as matrix metalloprotease-12. In addition, it was found that macrophages in COPD have an impaired ability to clear respiratory pathogens and apoptotic cells. Macrophage phagocytic function in COPD can be restored at least in part, as shown by in vitro studies. In a search to further understand this altered function of macrophages in COPD, several studies have used a range of markers to phenotype macrophages in COPD. Macrophages constitute a heterogeneous cell population, and, currently, proinflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 and M2-like cells are considered to represent the extremes of a pattern of macrophage polarization. In COPD, there is no clear evidence for a predominance of one of these phenotypes, and an intermediate phenotype may be present. Future studies are needed to establish the nature of this apparent COPD-specific macrophage subset, and to link macrophage dysfunction to COPD phenotypes. },

Immunohistochemical techniques were used to examine CD163, CD204 and CD206, as M2 markers, expressed on alveolar macrophages in the lungs of patients with mild to very severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I (mild) n = 11, II (moderate) n = 9, III (severe) n = 2, and IV (very severe) n = 16). Fifteen smokers and 10 non-smokers were also examined for comparison. There were significantly higher numbers of alveolar macrophages in COPD patients than in smokers and non-smokers. The numbers and percentages of CD163+, CD204+ or CD206+ alveolar macrophages in patients with COPD at GOLD stages III and IV were significantly higher than in those at GOLD stages I and II, and those in smokers and non-smokers. In patients with COPD, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CD163+, CD204+ or CD206+ alveolar macrophages and the predicted forced expiratory volume in one second. Overexpression of CD163, CD204 and CD206 on lung alveolar macrophages may be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD.},

	Abstract = {The inflammatory process in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is active mainly in the airways, but little is known about the properties of the inflammatory cells in this compartment. We have studied leucocytes in induced sputum of COPD patients compared to controls in order to uncover what types of macrophages might be involved in the disease. Sputum induction was performed by inhalation of nebulized sodium chloride solution. Leucocytes were isolated and stained with specific monoclonal antibodies for analysis in flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a major portion of CD14+ macrophages in COPD has lower forward scatter, i.e. they are small macrophages. While in control donors these small macrophages accounted for 6.9% of all macrophages, the percentage of these cells in COPD was 45.7%. CD14 and HLA-DR expression was high on these small sputum macrophages while the large sputum macrophages expressed only low levels of these surface molecules, both in control donors and COPD patients. Small sputum macrophages of both control donors and COPD patients showed higher levels of constitutive tumour necrosis factor (TNF) compared to the large macrophages. TNF was inducible by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preferentially in the small sputum macrophages in the control donors but there was no further induction in COPD patients. These data show that the small sputum macrophages are a major macrophage population in COPD and that these cells exhibit features of highly active inflammatory cells and may therefore be instrumental in airway inflammation in COPD.},

@article{Finkelstein1995Alveolar-inflam,
	Abstract = {The prevalent theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema proposes that increased numbers of activated neutrophils and/or alveolar macrophages produce large amounts of proteases, an activity that cannot be regulated by alpha 1-antiproteases, resulting in lung destruction. However, the cells in the lung parenchyma of smokers have not been properly identified. We characterized and quantitated the inflammatory cell load in the lungs of smokers and correlated these findings with the degree of lung destruction. Twenty-one patients, six nonsmokers and 15 smokers, undergoing lung resection were studied. Lungs or lobes were fixed and stained for light microscopy and neutrophil identification and immunohistochemically stained for identification of lymphocytes and macrophages. By point counting, we determined the extent of emphysema by the volume density of the lung parenchyma (Vvalv), and the different cell numbers per cubic millimeter in all lungs. In nonsmokers Vvalv was greater than in smokers. The number of neutrophils/mm3 of lung correlated directly with the Vvalv, (r = 0.71, p < 0.01), whereas the number of alveolar macrophages (r = -0.70) and T-lymphocytes (r = -0.78) correlated negatively with the Vvalv. The number of T-lymphocytes correlated negatively with the number of neutrophils (r = -0.58) and positively with the numbers of alveolar macrophages (r = 0.77). Our data suggest that as long as the inflammatory reaction is predominantly of neutrophils there is no destruction of the lung. However, the extent of lung destruction becomes evident, and its extent is directly related to the number of alveolar macrophages and T-lymphocytes/mm3. We conclude that the T-lymphocyte might be importantly implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema in smokers.},

	Abstract = {Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) contains complex tissue-specific components that work in concert to promote tissue repair and constructive remodeling and has been used experimentally and clinically to accelerate epithelial wound repair, leading us to hypothesize that lung-derived ECM could mitigate acute lung injury. To explore the therapeutic potential of ECM for noninvasive delivery to the lung, we decellularized and solubilized porcine lung ECM, then characterized the composition, concentration, particle size and stability of the preparation. The ECM preparation at 3.2 mg/mL with average particle size <3 mum was tested in vitro on human A549 lung epithelial cells exposed to 95% O2 for 24 hours, and in vivo by tracheal instillation or nebulization into the lungs of rats exposed intermittently or continuously to 90% O2 for a cumulative 72 hours. Our results showed that the preparation was enriched in collagen, reduced in glycosaminoglycans, and contained various bioactive molecules. Particle size was concentration-dependent. Compared to the respective controls treated with cell culture medium in vitro or saline in vivo, ECM inhalation normalized cell survival and alveolar morphology, and reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and oxidative damage. This proof-of-concept study established the methodology, feasibility and therapeutic potential of exogenous solubilized ECM for pulmonary cytoprotection, possibly as an adjunct or potentiator of conventional therapy.},

@article{Pugliese2015The-role-of-inf,
	Abstract = {Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases sharing the common feature of chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. The disease is usually characterized by mild to moderate pulmonary vascular remodeling that is largely thought to be reversible compared with the progressive irreversible disease seen in World Health Organization (WHO) group I disease. However, in these patients, the presence of PH significantly worsens morbidity and mortality. In addition, a small subset of patients with hypoxic PH develop {\textquotedblleft}out-of-proportion{\textquotedblright} severe pulmonary hypertension characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling that is irreversible and similar to that in WHO group I disease. In all cases of hypoxia-related vascular remodeling and PH, inflammation, particularly persistent inflammation, is thought to play a role. This review focuses on the effects of hypoxia on pulmonary vascular cells and the signaling pathways involved in the initiation and perpetuation of vascular inflammation, especially as they relate to vascular remodeling and transition to chronic irreversible PH. We hypothesize that the combination of hypoxia and local tissue factors/cytokines ({\textquotedblleft}second hit{\textquotedblright}) antagonizes tissue homeostatic cellular interactions between mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts and/or smooth muscle cells) and macrophages and arrests these cells in an epigenetically locked and permanently activated proremodeling and proinflammatory phenotype. This aberrant cellular cross-talk between mesenchymal cells and macrophages promotes transition to chronic nonresolving inflammation and vascular remodeling, perpetuating PH. A better understanding of these signaling pathways may lead to the development of specific therapeutic targets, as none are currently available for WHO group III disease.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Lung antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs) are major sentinels of innate immunity by preventing microbial colonization and infection. Nevertheless bactericidal activity of AMPs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is compromised in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and asthma. Evidence is accumulating that expression of harmful human serine proteases, matrix metalloproteases and cysteine cathepsins is markedely increased in these chronic lung diseases. The local imbalance between proteases and protease inhibitors compromises lung tissue integrity and function, by not only degrading extracellular matrix components, but also non-matrix proteins. Despite the fact that AMPs are somewhat resistant to proteolytic degradation, some human proteases cleave them efficiently and impair their antimicrobial potency. By contrast, certain AMPs may be effective as antiproteases. Host proteases participate in concert with bacterial proteases in the degradation of key innate immunity peptides/proteins and thus may play immunomodulatory activities during chronic lung diseases. In this context, the present review highlights the current knowledge and recent discoveries on the ability of host enzymes to interact with AMPs, providing a better understanding of the role of human proteases in innate host defense.},

@article{Badylak2014Decellularized-,
	Abstract = {Biologic scaffold materials composed of mammalian extracellular matrix (ECM) are prepared by decellularization of source tissues harvested from either humans (allogeneic) or a variety of other (xenogeneic) species. These matrix scaffold materials are commonly regulated and used as surgical mesh materials for applications such as ventral hernia repair, musculotendinous tissue reconstruction, dura mater replacement, reconstructive breast surgery, pelvic floor reconstruction, and the treatment of cutaneous ulcers, among others. The clinical results for these applications vary widely for reasons which include characteristics of the source tissue, methods and efficacy of tissue decellularization, and methods of processing/manufacturing. However, the primary determinant of success or failure in the clinical setting is the response of the host to these implanted biologic scaffold materials. It is logical to question why any non-self biologic material, particularly a xenogeneic material, would not elicit an early and aggressive adverse immune response. The present manuscript briefly describes the known mechanisms by which these biologic scaffold materials can facilitate a constructive remodeling response, the known causative factors of an adverse response, and provides a general discussion of the role of the macrophage in determining outcome.},

@article{Plataki2006Apoptotic-mecha,
	Abstract = {COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, characterized by a chronic abnormal inflammatory response to noxious agents. Apoptosis is a physiologic process, critical to cellular homeostasis, in which cell death follows a programmed sequence of events. Apoptosis has been recognized to play an important role in clinical and experimental models of lung diseases. Abnormal apoptotic events in smokers'and in emphysematous lungs have been shown in epithelial and endothelial lung cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and myocytes. Many factors associated with COPD, including cigarette smoke, have the potential to cause apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, the main sites of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. The decreased expression of VEGF, a known survival factor for endothelial cells, and its receptor, results in lung septal endothelial cell death, leading perhaps to the emphysema observed in COPD. In smokers who develop COPD there is an activation of adaptive immunity, with an infiltration of CD4+ and, especially, CD8 + cells. CD8 + cells are cytotoxic to epithelial cells through the release of granzymes and perforin, which can further induce apoptosis of alveolar cells. Moreover, any reduction in neutrophil apoptosis or dysregulation of macrophage uptake of apoptotic neutrophils could lead to chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Increased rates of T-cell apoptosis may lead to a defective immune response to infective organisms, contributing to the high frequency of infections seen in COPD. Increased apoptosis of skeletal muscle could be responsible for the skeletal muscle atrophy, the main cause of unexplained weight loss in patients with COPD. This paper is a review of the current knowledge on the apoptotic pathways involved in COPD pathogenesis and their interaction with other known contributing factors.},

	Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a growing clinical problem which can result in breathlessness or respiratory failure and has an average life expectancy of 3 years from diagnosis.

@article{Ploeger2013Cell-plasticity,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macrophages and fibroblasts are two major players in tissue repair and fibrosis. Despite the relevance of macrophages and fibroblasts in tissue homeostasis, remarkably little is known whether macrophages are able to influence the properties of fibroblasts. Here we investigated the role of paracrine factors secreted by classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) human macrophages on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). RESULTS: HDFs stimulated with paracrine factors from M1 macrophages showed a 10 to > 100-fold increase in the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL6, CCL2 and CCL7 and the matrix metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP3. This indicates that factors produced by M1 macrophages induce a fibroblast phenotype with pro-inflammatory and extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading properties. HDFs stimulated with paracrine factors secreted by M2 macrophages displayed an increased proliferation rate. Interestingly, the M1-activated pro-inflammatory fibroblasts downregulated, after exposure to paracrine factors produced by M2 macrophages or non-conditioned media, the inflammatory markers as well as MMPs and upregulated their collagen production. CONCLUSIONS: Paracrine factors of M1 or M2 polarized macrophages induced different phenotypes of HDFs and the HDF phenotypes can in turn be reversed, pointing to a high dynamic plasticity of fibroblasts in the different phases of tissue repair.},

@article{Newby2008Metalloproteina,
	Abstract = {Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade strength-giving collagens and other structural proteins of the arterial extracellular matrix. Overproduction of MMPs by monocyte/macrophages could therefore promote atherosclerotic plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. Freshly-recruited monocyte macrophages appear to use a prostaglandin (PG)-dependent pathway to coordinately upregulate a broad and potentially highly-destructive spectrum of MMPs. Differentiated macrophages rely on a series of distinct pathways to selectively upregulate groups of MMPs. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that different macrophage phenotypes express characteristically different spectra of MMPs and their inhibitors. New therapies may result from targeting matrix MMP overproduction.},

	Abstract = {Use of de-cellularized cadaveric lungs as 3-dimensional scaffolds for ex vivo lung tissue generation offers a new potential therapeutic approach for clinical lung transplantation. However, it is likely that some of the available cadaveric human lungs may be from older donors or from donors with previously existing structural lung diseases such as emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis. It is not known whether these lungs will be suitable for either de-cellularization or re-cellularization. To investigate this, we assessed the effects of advanced age, representative emphysematous and fibrotic injuries, and the combination of advanced age and emphysematous injury and found significant differences both in histologic appearance and in the retention of extracellular matrix (ECM) and other proteins, as assessed by immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, between the different conditions. However, despite these differences, binding, retention and growth of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) over a 1-month period following intratracheal inoculation were similar between the different experimental conditions. In contrast, significant differences occurred in the growth of \{C10\} mouse lung epithelial cells between the different conditions. Therefore, age, lung injury, and the cell type used for re-cellularization may significantly impact the usefulness of de-cellularized whole lungs for ex vivo lung tissue regeneration. },

	Abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a meshwork of both structural and functional proteins assembled in unique tissue-specific architectures. The \{ECM\} both provides the mechanical framework for each tissue and organ and is a substrate for cell signaling. The \{ECM\} is highly dynamic, and cells both receive signals from the \{ECM\} and contribute to its content and organization. This process of ``dynamic reciprocity'' is key to tissue development and for homeostasis. Based upon these important functions, ECM-based materials have been used in a wide variety of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches to tissue reconstruction. It has been demonstrated that ECM-based materials, when appropriately prepared, can act as inductive templates for constructive remodeling. Specifically, such materials act as templates for the induction of de novo functional, site-appropriate, tissue formation. Herein, the diverse structural and functional roles of the \{ECM\} are reviewed to provide a rationale for the use of \{ECM\} scaffolds in regenerative medicine. Translational examples of \{ECM\} scaffolds in regenerative are provided, and the potential mechanisms by which \{ECM\} scaffolds elicit constructive remodeling are discussed. A better understanding of the ability of \{ECM\} scaffold materials to define the microenvironment of the injury site will lead to improved clinical outcomes associated with their use. },

Biomaterials that match the elastic modulus of soft tissues have been effective for studying this cell mechanobiology, but improvements are needed in order to investigate a wider range of physicochemical properties in a controlled manner. We hypothesized that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) blends could be used as the basis of a tunable system where the elastic modulus could be adjusted to match most types of soft tissue. To test this we formulated blends of two commercially available PDMS types, Sylgard 527 and Sylgard 184, which enabled us to fabricate substrates with an elastic modulus anywhere from 5 kPa up to 1.72 MPa. This is a three order-of-magnitude range of tunability, exceeding what is possible with other hydrogel and PDMS systems. Uniquely, the elastic modulus can be controlled independently of other materials properties including surface roughness, surface energy and the ability to functionalize the surface by protein adsorption and microcontact printing. For biological validation, PC12 (neuronal inducible-pheochromocytoma cell line) and C2C12 (muscle cell line) were used to demonstrate that these PDMS formulations support cell attachment and growth and that these substrates can be used to probe the mechanosensitivity of various cellular processes including neurite extension and muscle differentiation.},

	N2 = {Eps8 is an actin regulatory scaffold protein whose expression is increased in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. It forms a complex with both focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2) and Src in SCC cells derived from skin carcinomas induced by administration of the chemical DMBA followed by TPA (the DMBA/TPA model). Here, we describe two new roles for Eps8. Firstly, it controls the spatial distribution of active Src in a FAK-dependent manner. Specifically, Eps8 participates in, and regulates, a biochemical complex with Src and drives trafficking of Src to autophagic structures that SCC cells use to cope with high levels of active Src when FAK is absent. Secondly, when FAK is expressed in SCC cells, thereby meaning active Src becomes tethered at focal adhesion complexes, Eps8 is also recruited to focal adhesions and is required for FAK-dependent polarization and invasion. Therefore, Eps8 is a crucial mediator of Src- and FAK-regulated processes; it participates in specific biochemical complexes and promotes actin re-arrangements that determine the spatial localization of Src, and modulates the functions of Src and FAK during invasive migration.},

	N2 = {Arterial hemodynamic shear stress and blood vessel stiffening both significantly influence the arterial endothelial cell (EC) phenotype and atherosclerosis progression, and both have been shown to signal through cell-matrix adhesions. However, the cooperative effects of fluid shear stress and matrix stiffness on ECs remain unknown. To investigate these cooperative effects, we cultured bovine aortic ECs on hydrogels matching the elasticity of the intima of compliant, young, or stiff, aging arteries. The cells were then exposed to laminar fluid shear stress of 12 dyn/cm2. Cells grown on more compliant matrices displayed increased elongation and tighter EC-cell junctions. Notably, cells cultured on more compliant substrates also showed decreased RhoA activation under laminar shear stress. Additionally, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in response to fluid shear stress occurred more rapidly in ECs cultured on more compliant substrates, and nitric oxide production was enhanced. Together, our results demonstrate that a signaling cross talk between stiffness and fluid shear stress exists within the vascular microenvironment, and, importantly, matrices mimicking young and healthy blood vessels can promote and augment the atheroprotective signals induced by fluid shear stress. These data suggest that targeting intimal stiffening and/or the EC response to intima stiffening clinically may improve vascular health.},

The setup allows for measurements of cell morphology and inflammatory response to the combined stimuli, and identifies mechanisms by which vascular stiffening leads to pathological responses to blood flow. We found that the magnitude of shear stress required to affect endothelial cell morphology and inflammatory response depended on substrate stiffness. Endothelial cells on 100 Pa substrates demonstrate a greater increase in cell area and cortical stiffness and decrease in NF-B nuclear translocation in response to TNF- treatment compared to controls than cells plated on 10 kPa substrates. The response of endothelial cells on soft substrates to shear stress depends on the presence of hyaluronan (HA). These results emphasize the importance of substrate stiffness on endothelial function, and elucidate a means by which vascular stiffening in aging and disease can impact the endothelium.},

	N2 = {Endothelial cell (EC) morphology and functions can be highly impacted by the mechanical stresses that the cells experience in vivo. In most areas in the vasculature, ECs are continuously exposed to unsteady blood flow-induced shear stress and vasodilation-contraction-induced tensile stress/strain simultaneously. Investigations on how ECs respond to combined shear stress and tensile strain will help us to better understand how an altered mechanical environment affects EC mechanotransduction, dysfunction, and associated cardiovascular disease development. In the present study, a programmable shearing and stretching device that can apply dynamic fluid shear stress and cyclic tensile strain simultaneously to cultured ECs was developed. Flow and stress/strain conditions in the device were simulated using a fluid structure interaction (FSI) model. To characterize the performance of this device and the effect of combined shear stress-tensile strain on EC morphology, human coronary artery ECs (HCAECs) were exposed to concurrent shear stress and cyclic tensile strain in the device. Changes in EC morphology were evaluated through cell elongation, cell alignment, and cell junctional actin accumulation. Results obtained from the numerical simulation indicated that in the "in-plane" area of the device, both fluid shear stress and biaxial tensile strain were uniform. Results obtained from the in vitro experiments demonstrated that shear stress, alone or combined with cyclic tensile strain, induced significant cell elongation. While biaxial tensile strain alone did not induce any appreciable change in EC elongation. Fluid shear stress and cyclic tensile strain had different effects on EC actin filament alignment and accumulation. By combining various fluid shear stress and cyclic tensile strain conditions, this device can provide a physiologically relevant mechanical environment to study EC responses to physiological and pathological mechanical stimulation.},

Physiologically relevant in vitro studies of vascular cells therefore require realistic environments where in vivo mechanical loading conditions can be accurately reproduced. To accomplish a realistic in vivo-like loading environment, we designed and fabricated an Endothelial Cell Culture Model (ECCM) to generate physiological pressure, stretch, and shear stress profiles associated with normal and pathological cardiac flow states. Cells within this system were cultured on a stretchable, thin (∼500 μm) planar membrane within a rectangular flow channel and subject to constant fluid flow. Under pressure, the thin planar membrane assumed a concave shape, representing a segment of the blood vessel wall. Pulsatility was introduced using a programmable pneumatically controlled collapsible chamber. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were cultured within this system under normal conditions and compared to HAECs cultured under static and "flow only" (13 dyn/cm(2)) control conditions using microscopy. Cells cultured within the ECCM were larger than both controls and assumed an ellipsoidal shape. In contrast to static control control cells, ECCM-cultured cells exhibited alignment of cytoskeletal actin filaments and high and continuous expression levels of β-catenin indicating an in vivo-like phenotype. In conclusion, design, fabrication, testing, and validation of the ECCM for culture of ECs under realistic pressure, flow, strain, and shear loading seen in normal and pathological conditions was accomplished. The ECCM therefore is an enabling technology that allows for study of ECs under physiologically relevant biomechanical loading conditions in vitro.},

	Abstract = {The cytoplasmic domains (tails) of heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors mediate integrins' biological functions by binding to cytoplasmic proteins. Most integrin β tails contain one or two NPXY/F motifs that can form β turns. These motifs are part of a canonical recognition sequence for phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, protein modules that are present in a wide variety of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins. Indeed, talin and ICAP1-α bind to integrin β tails by means of a PTB domain--NPXY ligand interaction. To assess the generality of this interaction we examined the binding of a series of recombinant PTB domains to a panel of short integrin β tails. In addition to the known integrin-binding proteins, we found that Numb (a negative regulator of Notch signaling) and Dok-1 (a signaling adaptor involved in cell migration) and their isolated PTB domain bound to integrin tails. Furthermore, Dok-1 physically associated with integrin αIIbβ3. Mutations of the integrin β tails confirmed that these interactions are canonical PTB domain--ligand interactions. First, the interactions were blocked by mutation of an NPXY motif in the integrin tail. Second, integrin class-specific interactions were observed with the PTB domains of Dab, EPS8, and tensin. We used this specificity, and a molecular model of an integrin β tail--PTB domain interaction to predict critical interacting residues. The importance of these residues was confirmed by generation of gain- and loss-of-function mutations in β7 and β3 tails. These data establish that short integrin β tails interact with a large number of PTB domain-containing proteins through a structurally conserved mechanism.},

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major cytokine associated with fibrosis that induces excessive synthesis of matrix proteins, particularly PGs. Owing to the importance of PGs in matrix assembly and in mediating cytokine and growth factor signaling, a strategy based on the inhibition of PG synthesis may prevent excessive matrix PG deposition and attenuates profibrotic effects of TGF-β1 in lung fibroblasts. Here, we showed that 4-MU4-deoxy-β-D-xylopyranoside, a competitive inhibitor of β4-galactosyltransferase7, inhibited PG synthesis and secretion in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing the level of both chondroitin/dermatan- and heparin-sulfate PG in primary lung fibroblasts. Importantly, 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside was able to counteract TGF-β1-induced synthesis of PGs, activation of fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside treatment inhibited TGF-β1-induced activation of canonical Smads2/3 signaling pathway in lung primary fibroblasts. The knockdown of β4-galactosyltransferase7 mimicked 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside effects, indicating selective inhibition of β4-galactosyltransferase7 by this compound. Collectively, this study reveals the anti-fibrotic activity of 4-MU4-deoxy-xyloside and indicates that inhibition of PG synthesis represents a novel strategy for the treatment of lung fibrosis.},

Because transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) promotes fibrosis, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits it, we hypothesized that TGF-beta(1) treatment would upregulate PG production in fibrotic lung fibroblasts, and IFN-gamma would abrogate this effect. Primary lung fibroblast cultures were established from rats 14 days after intratracheal instillation of saline (control) or BM (1.5 units). PGs were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis. Bleomycin-exposed lung fibroblasts (BLF) exhibited increased production of versican (VS), heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), and biglycan (BG) compared with normal lung fibroblasts (NLF). Compared with NLF, BLF released significantly increased amounts of TGF-beta(1). TGF-beta(1) (5 ng/ml for 48 h) upregulated PG expression in both BLF and NLF. Incubation of BLF with anti-TGF-beta antibody (1, 5, and 10 microg/ml) inhibited PG expression in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of BLF with IFN-gamma (500 U. ml(-1) x 48 h) reduced VS, HSPG, and BG expression. Furthermore, IFN-gamma inhibited TGF-beta(1)-induced increases in PG expression by these fibroblasts. Activation of fibroblasts by TGF-beta(1) promotes abnormal deposition of PGs in fibrotic lungs; downregulation of TGF-beta(1) by IFN-gamma may have potential therapeutic benefits in this disease.},

	N2 = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic disease of the lung parenchyma, without curative treatment. Gremlin is a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) antagonist, its expression being increased in IPF lungs. It has been implicated in promoting myofibroblast accumulation, likely through inhibited fibroblast apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In the current study, we examined the effects of selective adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Gremlin in rat lungs. We show that transient Gremlin overexpression results in activation of alveolar epithelial cells with proliferation and apoptosis, as well as partly reversible lung fibrosis. We found myofibroblasts arranged in fibroblastic foci. Fibroblast proliferation occurred delayed as compared with epithelial changes. Fibrotic pathology significantly declined after Day 14, the reversal being associated with an increase of the epithelium-protective element, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10. Our data indicate that Gremlin-mediated BMP inhibition results in activation of epithelial cells and transient fibrosis, but also induction of epithelium-protective FGF10. A Gremlin-BMP-FGF10 loop may explain these results, and demonstrate that the interactions between different factors are quite complex in fibrotic lung disease. Increased Gremlin expression in human IPF tissue may be an expression of continuing epithelial injury, and Gremlin may be part of activated repair mechanisms.},

The present study investigates the molecular organization of TGF-β-induced matrix adhesions. The study demonstrates that in various mouse and human epithelial cells TGF-βinduces cellular structures containing 2 matrix adhesions bridged by a stretch of actin fibers. These structures are similar to ventral stress fibers (VSFs). Suppression of integrin-β5 by RNA interference reduces VSFs in majority of cells ({$>$}; 75{\%}), while overexpression of integrin-β5 fragments revealed a critical role of a distinct sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of integrin-β5 in the VSF structures. In addition, the integrity of actin fibers and Src kinase activity contribute to integrin-β5-mediated signaling and VSF formation. TGF-β-Smad signaling upregulates actin-regulatory proteins, such as caldesmon, zyxin, and zyxin-binding protein Csrp1 in mouse and human epithelial cells. Suppression of zyxin markedly inhibits formation of VSFs in response to TGF-βand integrin-β5. Zyxin is localized at actin fibers and matrix adhesions of VSFs and might bridge integrin-β5-mediated adhesions to actin fibers. These findings provide a platform for defining the molecular mechanism regulating the organization and activities of VSFs in response to TGF-β.},

	N2 = {Mechanical strain plays a critical role in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of bone cells. As mechanical receptor cells, osteoblasts perceive and respond to stress force, such as those associated with compression, strain and shear stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process remain unclear. Using a four-point bending device, mouse MC3T3-E1 cells was exposed to mechanical tensile strain. Cell proliferation was determined to be most efficient when stimulated once a day by mechanical strain at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and intensities of 2500 µεwith once a day, and a periodicity of 1 h/day for 3 days. The applied mechanical strain resulted in the altered expression of 1992 genes, 41 of which are involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Activation of ERK by mechanical strain promoted cell proliferation and inactivation of ERK by PD98059 suppressed proliferation, confirming that ERK plays an important role in the response to mechanical strain. Furthermore, the membrane-associated receptors integrin β1 and integrin β5 were determined to regulate ERK activity and the proliferation of mechanical strain-treated MC3T3-E1 cells in opposite ways. The knockdown of integrin β1 led to the inhibition of ERK activity and cell proliferation, whereas the knockdown of integrin β5 led to the enhancement of both processes. This study proposes a novel mechanism by which mechanical strain regulates bone growth and remodeling.},

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-βsuperfamily, have anti-fibrogenic functions, in contrast to TGF-β, in the kidney, lung, and liver. However, it is not known whether BMPs have an anti-fibrogenic role in the pancreas. The current study was designed to investigate the potential anti-fibrogenic role of BMPs in the pancreas using an in vivo CP model and an in vitro PSC model. CP was induced by repetitive intraperitoneal injections of cerulein in adult Swiss Webster mice. The control mice received saline injections. Compared with the control, cerulein injections induced a time-dependent increase in acinar injury and progression of fibrosis and a steady increase in inflammation. Cerulein injections also induced increases of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin and of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive stellate cells (PSCs). The mice receiving cerulein injections showed increased BMP2 protein levels and phosphorylated Smad1 levels up to 4 wk and then declined at 8 wk to similar levels as the control. In vitro, the isolated mouse and human PSCs were cultured and pretreated with BMP2 followed by TGF-βtreatment. BMP2 pretreatment inhibited TGF-β-induced α-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen type Ia expression. Knocking down Smad1 with small-interfering RNA reversed the inhibitory effect of BMP2 on TGF-β-induced α-SMA and fibronectin expression. Thus, BMP2 opposes the fibrogenic function of TGF-βin PSCs through the Smad1 signaling pathway.},

Although their causative mechanisms are quite diverse, these diseases share the common feature of an uncontrolled and progressive accumulation of fibrous tissue macromolecules in affected organs leading to their dysfunction and ultimate failure. The pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases is complex and despite extensive investigation has remained elusive. Numerous studies have identified myofibroblasts as the cells responsible for the establishment and progression of the fibrotic process. Tissue myofibroblasts in fibrotic diseases originate from several sources including quiescent tissue fibroblasts, circulating CD34+ fibrocytes, and the phenotypic conversion of various cell types including epithelial and endothelial cells into activated myofibroblasts. However, the role of the phenotypic transition of endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells (Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition or EndoMT) in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disorders has not been fully elucidated. Here, we review the evidence supporting EndoMT's contribution to human fibrotic disease pathogenesis.},

	N2 = {We have previously shown that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 protected against main pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and VEGF receptor blockade through a mechanism associated with ALK5-mediated Bcl-2 upregulation. In the current study, we investigated the effect of TGF-beta1 on pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) apoptosis. We found that, in contrast to the results seen in conduit PAEC, TGF-beta1 caused apoptosis of PMVEC, an effect that was also dependent on ALK5 activity. We noted that non-SMAD signaling pathways did not play a role in TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis. Both SMAD2 and SMAD1/5 were activated upon exposure to TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1-induced activation of SMAD2, but not SMAD1/5, was abolished by ALK5 inhibition, an effect that associated with prevention of TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that SMAD2 is important in TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis of PMVEC. While caspase-12 activity was not altered, caspase-8 was activated by TGF-beta1, an effect that correlated with a reduction of cFLIP protein levels. Additionally, TGF-beta1 decreased Bcl-2 protein levels and induced cytochrome c cytosolic redistribution. These results suggest that TGF-beta1 caused apoptosis of PMVEC likely through both caspase-8-dependent extrinsic pathway and mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. We noted that inhibition of ALK5 attenuated serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, an effect that correlated with increased expression and activation of CREB and its potential target genes, Bcl-2 and cFLIP. These results suggest that CREB may be important in mediating apoptosis resistance of PMVEC upon ALK5 inhibition perhaps through upregulation of Bcl-2 and cFLIP. Finally, we noted that SMAD1/5 were activated upon ALK5 inhibition in the presence of low levels of TGF-beta1, an effect associated with enhanced endothelial proliferation. We speculate that imbalance of ALK1 and ALK5 may contribute to the development of pulmonary artery hypertension.},

ECs were treated with BMP-2 or BMP-7 (200 ng/mL) for 24 hours in regular or serum-free (SF) medium, with and without addition of tumor necrosis factor alpha, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry (Annexin V), TUNEL, or caspase-3 activity. Treatment for 24 hours in SF medium increased apoptosis, and both BMP-2 and BMP-7 significantly reduced apoptosis in response to serum deprivation to levels not different from serum controls. Transfection with 5 microg of small interfering RNAs for BMPR2 produced specific gene silencing assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. BMPR2 gene silencing increased apoptosis almost 3-fold (P=0.0027), even in the presence of serum. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) isolated from normal subjects or patients with IPAH were differentiated in culture for 7 days and apoptosis was determined in the presence and absence of BMPs. BMP-2 reduced apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in EPCs from normal subjects but not in EPCs isolated from patients with IPAH. These results support the hypothesis that loss-of-function mutations in BMPR2 could lead to increased pulmonary EC apoptosis, representing a possible initiating mechanism in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension.},

Here, we report an interplay between PPARgamma and its transcriptional target apoE downstream of BMP-2 signaling. BMP-2/BMP-RII signaling prevented PDGF-BB-induced proliferation of human and murine pulmonary artery SMCs (PASMCs) by decreasing nuclear phospho-ERK and inducing DNA binding of PPARgamma that is independent of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. Both BMP-2 and a PPARgamma agonist stimulated production and secretion of apoE by SMCs. Using a variety of methods, including short hairpin RNAi in human PASMCs, PAH patient-derived BMP-RII mutant PASMCs, a PPARgamma antagonist, and PASMCs isolated from PPARgamma- and apoE-deficient mice, we demonstrated that the antiproliferative effect of BMP-2 was BMP-RII, PPARgamma, and apoE dependent. Furthermore, we created mice with targeted deletion of PPARgamma in SMCs and showed that they spontaneously developed PAH, as indicated by elevated RV systolic pressure, RV hypertrophy, and increased muscularization of the distal pulmonary arteries. Thus, PPARgamma-mediated events could protect against PAH, and PPARgamma agonists may reverse PAH in patients with or without BMP-RII dysfunction.},

Mutations of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor type II (BMP-RII) gene have been implicated in patients with familial and sporadic PPH. The objective of this study was to elucidate the apoptotic effects of BMPs on normal human PASMCs and to examine whether BMP-induced effects are altered in PASMCs from PPH patients. Using RT-PCR, we detected six isoforms of BMPs (BMP-1 through -6) and three subunits of BMP receptors (BMP-RIa, -RIb, and -RII) in PASMCs. Treatment of normal PASMCs with BMP-2 or -7 (100-200 nM, 24-48 h) markedly increased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. The BMP-2-mediated apoptosis in normal PASMCs was associated with a transient activation or phosphorylation of Smad1 and a marked downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. In PASMCs from PPH patients, the BMP-2- or BMP-7-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited compared with PASMCs from patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension. These results suggest that the antiproliferative effect of BMPs is partially due to induction of PASMC apoptosis, which serves as a critical mechanism to maintain normal cell number in the pulmonary vasculature. Inhibition of BMP-induced PASMC apoptosis in PPH patients may play an important role in the development of pulmonary vascular medial hypertrophy in these patients.},

Our previous study indicated that bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (BMP‐2) significantly reversed transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1‐induced renal interstitial fibrosis. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanism and elucidate the regulation of EMT process under BMP‐2 treatment. Cultured renal interstitial fibroblast (NRK‐49F) was treated with TGF‐β1 (10 ng/ml) with or without BMP‐2 (10--250 ng/ml) for 24 h. The expression of α‐smooth muscle actin (α‐SMA), E‐cadherin, fibronectin, or Snail transcriptional factors was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining or Western blotting. Cell migration was analyzed by wound‐healing assay. NRK‐49F treated with TGF‐β1 induced significant EMT including upregulatioin of α‐SMA, fibronectin, and snail proteins and down‐regulation of E‐cadherin. Interestingly, co‐treatment with BMP‐2 dose‐dependently reversed TGF‐β1‐induced cellular fibrosis, cell migration, and above EMT change. The above effect was closely correlated with Snail since BMP‐2 dose‐and time‐course dependently induced a significant decrease in the level of Snail. Moreover, Snail siRNA significantly reversed TGF‐β1‐induced increases in the level of α‐SMA and fibronectin (intracellular and extracellular). We suppose that BMP‐2 have the potential to attenuate TGF‐β1‐induced renal interstitial fibrosis by attenuating Snail expression and reversing EMT process. J. Cell.

Knock‐down ‐2 enhanced ‐β1‐mediated ‐δand mad3 signalling cascades. In contrast, treatment with Y‐27632 or ‐431542, respectively suppressed ROCK‐dependent PKC‐δand Smad3 activation, but ‐2 was only up‐regulated by Y‐27632. In addition, ‐2 silencing abolished the effect of Y‐27632, but not ‐431542 on suppression of ‐β1 pathway. Further experiments showed that mad6 murf1 interaction were required for ‐2‐evoked antagonizing effects. mad6 overexpression attenuated ‐β1‐induced activation of ‐δand mad3, promoted ‐βdegradation in ‐2 knock‐down cardiomyocytes, and could be abolished after knocking‐down Smurf‐1, in which mad6/murf1 complex formation was critically involved. data showed that pressure overload‐induced collagen deposition was attenuated, cardiac function was improved and ‐β1‐dependent activation of ‐δand mad3 was reduced after 2 weeks treatment with rh‐2(0.5 mg/kg) or Y‐27632 (10 mg/kg) in mice that underwent surgical transverse aortic constriction.

Given the low penetrance of BMPRII mutations, abnormalities in other converging signaling pathways may be necessary for disease development. We hypothesized that BMPRII supports normal PAEC function by recruiting Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathways to promote proliferation, survival, and motility. In this study, we report that BMP-2, via BMPRII-mediated inhibition of GSK3-beta, induces beta-catenin (beta-C) accumulation and transcriptional activity necessary for PAEC survival and proliferation. At the same time, BMP-2 mediates phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1) or, with loss of BMPRII, pSmad3-dependent recruitment of Disheveled (Dvl) to promote RhoA-Rac1 signaling necessary for motility. Finally, using an angiogenesis assay in severe combined immunodeficient mice, we demonstrate that both beta-C- and Dvl-mediated RhoA-Rac1 activation are necessary for vascular growth in vivo. These findings suggest that the recruitment of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways is required in BMP-2-mediated angiogenesis.},

CS produced rapid (10 min) increases in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, activation of p38 and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 MAP kinases, and actomyosin remodeling.

HPAEC preconditioned at 18{\%} CS, but not at 5{\%} CS, exhibited significantly enhanced thrombin-induced reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance but did not affect barrier protective effect of sphingosine-1-phosphate (0.5 microM). Finally, expression profiling analysis revealed a number of genes, including small GTPase rho, apoptosis mediator ZIP kinase, and proteinase activated receptor-2, to be regulated by CS in an amplitude-dependent manner.

On the macro scale the stiffness of tissues and organs within the human body span several orders of magnitude 4 . Much less is known about how stiffness varies spatially within tissues, and what the scope and spatial scale of stiffness changes are in disease processes that result in tissue remodeling. To better understand how changes in matrix stiffness contribute to cellular physiology in health and disease, measurements of tissue stiffness obtained at a spatial scale relevant to resident cells are needed. This is particularly true for the lung, a highly compliant and elastic tissue in which matrix remodeling is a prominent feature in diseases such as asthma, emphysema, hypertension and fibrosis. To characterize the local mechanical environment of lung parenchyma at a spatial scale relevant to resident cells, we have developed methods to directly measure the local elastic properties of fresh murine lung tissue using atomic force microscopy (AFM) microindentation. With appropriate choice of AFM indentor, cantilever, and indentation depth, these methods allow measurements of local tissue shear modulus in parallel with phase contrast and fluorescence imaging of the region of interest. Systematic sampling of tissue strips provides maps of tissue mechanical properties that reveal local spatial variations in shear modulus. Correlations between mechanical properties and underlying anatomical and pathological features illustrate how stiffness varies with matrix deposition in fibrosis. These methods can be extended to other soft tissues and disease processes to reveal how local tissue mechanical properties vary across space and disease progression.},

Because of the presence of tissue folding and crumpling, previous measurements of the alveolar surface area available for gas exchange are not equivalent to the epithelial surface area. To identify epithelial deformations in uniformly inflated lungs representative of the in vivo condition, we studied isolated Sprague-Dawley rat lungs (n = 31) fixed by perfusion with glutaraldehyde on deflation after cycling three times at high lung volume (10-25 cmH2O). The epithelial basement membrane in 45 electron micrographs (x12,000)/rat was traced, digitally scanned, and analyzed. Epithelial basement membrane surface area (EBMSA) was computed from a morphometric relationship. EBMSA was found to increase 5, 16, 12, and 40{\%} relative to EBMSA at 24{\%} total lung capacity at lung volumes of 42, 60, 82, and 100{\%} total lung capacity, respectively. The increases in EBMSA suggest that epithelial cells undergo significant deformations with large inflations and that alveolar basement membrane deformation may contribute to lung recoil at high lung pressures.},

	N2 = {Alveolar overdistension and mechanical stresses generated by repetitive opening and closing of small airways and alveoli have been widely recognized as two primary mechanistic factors that may contribute to the development of ventilator-induced lung injury. A long-duration exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to even small, shear stresses could lead to the changes in cytoskeleton and the production of inflammatory mediators. In this paper, we have made an attempt to estimate in situ the magnitudes of mechanical stresses exerted on the alveolar walls during repetitive alveolar reopening by using a tape-peeling model of McEwan and Taylor (35). To this end, we first speculate the possible ranges of capillary number (Ca) ≡μU/γ(a dimensionless combination of surface tension γ, fluid viscosity μ, and alveolar opening velocity U) during in vivo alveolar opening. Subsequent calculations show that increasing respiratory rate or inflation rate serves to increase the values of mechanical stresses. For a normal lung, the predicted maximum shear stresses are 300 dyn/cm(2) across a cell, possibly inducing epithelial hydraulic cracks. In addition, we have conceived of a geometrical model of alveolar opening to make a prediction of the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) required to splint open a collapsed alveolus, which as shown by our results, covers a wide range of pressures, from several centimeters to dozens of centimeters of water, strongly depending on the underlying pulmonary conditions. The establishment of adequate regional ventilation-to-perfusion ratios may prevent recruited alveoli from reabsorption atelectasis and accordingly, reduce the required levels of PEEP. The present study and several recent animal experiments likewise suggest that a lung-protective ventilation strategy should not only include small tidal volume and plateau pressure limitations but also consider such cofactors as ventilation frequency and inflation rate.},

Cultured monolayers of bovine aortic endothelial cells are placed in a cone-plate apparatus that produces a uniform fluid shear stress on replicate samples. Subconfluent endothelial cultures continuously exposed to 1-5 dynes/cm2 shear proliferate at a rate comparable to that of static cultures and reach the same saturation density (congruent to 1.0-1.5 X 10(5) cells/cm2). When exposed to a laminar shear stress of 5-10 dynes/cm2, confluent monolayers undergo a time-dependent change in cell shape from polygonal to ellipsoidal and become uniformly oriented with flow. Regeneration of linear "wounds" in confluent monolayer appears to be influenced by the direction of the applied force. Preliminary studies indicate that certain endothelial cell functions, including fluid endocytosis, cytoskeletal assembly and nonthrombogenic surface properties, also are sensitive to shear stress. These observations suggest that fluid mechanical forces can directly influence endothelial cell structure and function. Modulation of endothelial behavior by fluid shear stresses may be relevant to normal vessel wall physiology, as well as the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.},

	N2 = {The relationships between fluid shear stress, a physiologically relevant mechanical force in the circulatory system, and pinocytosis (fluid-phase endocytosis) were investigated in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells using a specially designed apparatus. Continuous exposure to steady shear stresses (1-15 dyn/cm2) in laminar flow stimulated time- and amplitude-dependent increases in pinocytotic rate which returned to control levels after several hours. After 48 h continuous exposure to steady shear stress, removal to static conditions also resulted in a transient increase in pinocytotic rate, suggesting that temporal fluctuations in shear stress may influence endothelial cell function. Endothelial pinocytotic rates remained constant during exposure to rapidly oscillating shear stress at near physiological frequency (1 Hz) in laminar flow. In contrast, however, a sustained elevation of pinocytotic rate occurred when cells were subjected to fluctuations in shear stress amplitude (3-13 dyn/cm2) of longer cycle time (15 min), suggesting that changes in blood flow of slower periodicity may influence pinocytotic vesicle formation. As determined by {$[$}3H{$]$}thymidine autoradiography, neither steady nor oscillating shear stress stimulated the proliferation of confluent endothelial cells. These observations indicate that: (a) alterations in fluid shear stress can significantly influence the rate of formation of pinocytotic vesicles in vascular endothelial cells, (b) this process is force- and time-dependent and shows accommodation, (c) certain patterns of fluctuation in shear stress result in sustained elevation of pinocytotic rate, and (d) shear stresses can modulate endothelial pinocytosis independent of growth stimulation. These findings are relevant to (i) transendothelial transport and the metabolism of macromolecules in normal endothelium and (ii) the role of hemodynamic factors in the localization of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo.},

	N2 = {Pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) are enriched with progenitor cells that underlie their rapid proliferation and vasculogenic capacity. However, the molecular basis for such an enhanced growth potential is unknown. Nucleosome assembly protein-1 (NAP1), and its related family of proteins, have been incriminated in control of cell growth in a range of species. We therefore sought to determine whether NAP1 contributes to the rapid proliferation and vasculogenesis that is observed in PMVECs. NAP1 was expressed at a high level in two fast-growing cell types, including PMVECs and resident microvascular endothelial progenitor cells that were selected from PMVECs, whereas it was expressed at a low level in slow-growing pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). Heterologous NAP1 expression increased the growth potential of PAECs, whereas inhibiting NAP1 expression reduced the growth potential of PMVECs. Despite its impact on endothelial cell growth, NAP1 did not influence the expression of endothelial cell-selective markers (PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor), and it did not influence cell type-specific lectin binding criterion; PMVECs interact with Griffonia simplicifolia lectin, whereas PAECs interact with Helix pomatia lectin. PMVECs possess a higher basal transelectrical resistance than do PAECs, indicative of their more restrictive barrier property. Changing NAP1 expression did not normalize this basal barrier function between PMVECs and PAECs. To examine whether the growth-promoting actions of NAP1 influence blood vessel formation, endothelial cells were mixed into Matrigel and subcutaneously implanted. PMVECs generated eightfold more blood vessels than did PAECs over a 10-day time course. Heterologous NAP1 expression in PAECs increased the number of blood vessels formed by this cell type, where blood vessel growth approached that seen with PMVECs. Thus, our findings indicate that NAP1 functions as an important regulator of the proliferative and vasculogenic endothelial cell phenotype without globally impacting endothelial cell phenotype specification. {$[$}PUBLICATION ABSTRACT{$]$}},

	N2 = {Despite considerable progress in the understanding of endothelial barrier regulation and the identification of approaches that have the potential to improve endothelial barrier function, no drug- or stem cell-based therapy is presently available to reverse the widespread vascular leak that is observed in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. The translational gap suggests a need to develop experimental approaches and tools that better mimic the complex environment of the microcirculation in which the vascular leak develops. Recent studies have identified several elements of this microenvironment. Among these are composition and stiffness of the extracellular matrix, fluid shear stress, interaction of endothelial cells (ECs) with pericytes, oxygen tension, and the combination of toxic and mechanic injurious stimuli. Development of novel cell culture techniques that integrate these elements would allow in-depth analysis of EC biology that closely approaches the (patho)physiological conditions in situ. In parallel, techniques to isolate organ-specific ECs, to define EC heterogeneity in its full complexity, and to culture patient-derived ECs from inducible pluripotent stem cells or endothelial progenitor cells are likely to advance the understanding of ARDS and lead to development of therapeutics. This review 1) summarizes the advantages and pitfalls of EC cultures to study vascular leak in ARDS, 2) provides an overview of elements of the microvascular environment that can directly affect endothelial barrier function, and 3) discusses alternative methods to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical application with the intent of improving the translational value of present EC culture approaches.},

Alveolar capillary endothelial cells were intensely immunoreactive with CD34 but not with von Willebrand factor. Vascular density, that is, the relative ratio of capillary area to total area of alveolar walls, was significantly higher at low grades of fibrosis than in control lungs, whereas vascular density gradually decreased as the degree of fibrosis increased and was lower than that of control lungs in the most extensively fibrotic lesions. No vessels were observed inside fibroblastic foci. The potent angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8 were abundantly produced by capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in highly vascularized alveolar walls. In contrast, venules with CD34-negative but von Willebrand factor-positive endothelial cells localized in the center of the fibrotic lesions were slightly increased and identified as postcapillary venules by three-dimensional reconstructed images. These results indicate the presence of heterogeneous vascular remodeling in usual interstitial pneumonia.},

	N2 = {BACKGROUND---: The vascular remodeling responsible for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves predominantly the accumulation of α-smooth muscle actin--expressing mesenchymal-like cells in obstructive pulmonary vascular lesions. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) may be a source of those α-smooth muscle actin--expressing cells. METHODS AND RESULTS---: In situ evidence of EndoMT in human PAH was obtained by using confocal microscopy of multiple fluorescent stainings at the arterial level, and by using transmission electron microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy at the ultrastructural level. Findings were confirmed by in vitro analyses of human PAH and control cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells. In addition, the mRNA and protein signature of EndoMT was recognized at the arterial and lung level by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. We confirmed our human observations in established animal models of pulmonary hypertension (monocrotaline and SuHx). After establishing the first genetically modified rat model linked to BMPR2 mutations (BMPR2 rats), we demonstrated that EndoMT is linked to alterations in signaling of BMPR2, a gene that is mutated in 70{\%} of cases of familial PAH and in 10{\%} to 40{\%} of cases of idiopathic PAH. We identified molecular actors of this pathological transition, including twist overexpression and vimentin phosphorylation. We demonstrated that rapamycin partially reversed the protein expression patterns of EndoMT, improved experimental PAH, and decreased the migration of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, providing the proof of concept that EndoMT is druggable. CONCLUSIONS---: EndoMT is linked to alterations in BPMR2 signaling and is involved in the occlusive vas cular remodeling of PAH, findings that may have therapeutic implications.},

Recent evidence indicates that some fibroblasts in fibrosis may be derived from bone marrow progenitors as well as from epithelial cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition. To evaluate whether endothelial cells could represent an additional source for fibroblasts, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was established in Tie2-Cre/CAG-CAT-LacZ double-transgenic mice, in which LacZ was stably expressed in pan-endothelial cells. Combined X-gal staining and immunocytochemical staining for type I collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin revealed the presence of X-gal-positive cells in lung fibroblast cultures from bleomycin-treated mice. To explore the underlying mechanisms, by which loss of endothelial-specific markers and gain of mesenchymal phenotypes could be involved in microvascular endothelial cells, the effects of activated Ras and TGF-beta on the microvascular endothelial cell line MS1 were analyzed. Combined treatment with activated Ras and TGF-beta caused a significant loss of endothelial-specific markers, while inducing de novo mesenchymal phenotypes. The altered expression of these markers in MS1 cells with activated Ras persisted after withdrawal of TGF-beta in vitro and in vivo. These findings are the first to show that lung capillary endothelial cells could give rise to significant numbers of fibroblasts through an endothelial-mesenchymal transition in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model.},

In contrast, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) derived from vessel walls are widely considered to be differentiated, mature endothelial cells (ECs). However, similar to adult- and cord blood-derived EPCs, HUVECs and HAECs derived from vessel walls can be passaged for at least 40 population doublings in vitro. Based on this paradox, we tested whether EPCs reside in HUVECs or HAECs utilizing a novel single cell deposition assay that discriminates EPCs based on their proliferative and clonogenic potential. We demonstrate that a complete hierarchy of EPCs can be identified in HUVECs and HAECs derived from vessel walls and discriminated by their clonogenic and proliferative potential. This study provides evidence that a diversity of EPCs exists in human vessels and provides a conceptual framework for determining both the origin and function of EPCs in maintaining vessel integrity.},

	N2 = {Adult vascular endothelial stem cells are shown to reside in the blood vessel wall endothelium. When isolated, these cells are capable of clonal expansion and generate functional blood vessels in vivo.; In adults, the growth of blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis, is essential for organ growth and repair. In many disorders including cancer, angiogenesis becomes excessive. The cellular origin of new vascular endothelial cells (ECs) during blood vessel growth in angiogenic situations has remained unknown. Here, we provide evidence for adult vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) that reside in the blood vessel wall endothelium. VESCs constitute a small subpopulation within CD117+ (c-kit+) ECs capable of undergoing clonal expansion while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. Isolated VESCs can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells in vitro. A single transplanted c-kit-expressing VESC by the phenotype lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ can generate in vivo functional blood vessels that connect to host circulation. VESCs also have long-term self-renewal capacity, a defining functional property of adult stem cells. To provide functional verification on the role of c-kit in VESCs, we show that a genetic deficit in endothelial c-kit expression markedly decreases total colony-forming VESCs. In vivo, c-kit expression deficit resulted in impaired EC proliferation and angiogenesis and retardation of tumor growth. Isolated VESCs could be used in cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair to restore tissue vascularization after ischemic events. VESCs also provide a novel cellular target to block pathological angiogenesis and cancer growth.; Angiogenesis---the growth of blood vessels---is essential for organ growth and repair, but also occurs during tumorigenesis and in certain inflammatory disorders. All blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells (ECs)---thin, flattened cells that form a continuous monolayer throughout the entire circulatory system. The cellular origin of new vascular ECs during blood vessel growth in angiogenic situations in adults is a matter of debate. New ECs could develop, in principle, from as yet undiscovered stem cells, as is well documented for the differentiated cells of skin or epithelia, or by the duplication of existing differentiated ECs. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) that reside in the adult blood vessel wall endothelium. VESCs constitute a small subpopulation of ECs capable of clonal expansion, while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. When isolated, these VESCs can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells, and a single transplanted VESC can generate in vivo functional blood vessels that connect to host blood circulation. Isolated VESCs could be used in cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair to restore tissue vascularization following ischemia and could also be pursued as a novel cellular target of inhibition to block pathological angiogenesis, for example during tumor growth.},

Here we review recent progress in this so-called canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We discuss Wnt ligands, agonists, and antagonists, and their interactions with Wnt receptors. We also dissect critical events that regulate β-catenin stability, from Wnt receptors to the cytoplasmic β-catenin destruction complex, and nuclear machinery that mediates β-catenin-dependent transcription. Finally, we highlight some key aspects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human diseases including congenital malformations, cancer, and osteoporosis, and discuss potential therapeutic implications.},

	Abstract = {Here we present a method for establishing multiple component cell culture hydrogels for in vitro lung cell culture. Beginning with healthy en bloc lung tissue from porcine, rat, or mouse, the tissue is perfused and submerged in subsequent chemical detergents to remove the cellular debris. Histological comparison of the tissue before and after processing confirms removal of over 95{\%} of double stranded DNA and alpha galactosidase staining suggests the majority of cellular debris is removed. After decellularization, the tissue is lyophilized and then cryomilled into a powder. The matrix powder is digested for 48 hr in an acidic pepsin digestion solution and then neutralized to form the pregel solution. Gelation of the pregel solution can be induced by incubation at 37 $\,^{\circ}$C and can be used immediately following neutralization or stored at 4 $\,^{\circ}$C for up to two weeks. Coatings can be formed using the pregel solution on a non-treated plate for cell attachment. Cells can be suspended in the pregel prior to self-assembly to achieve a 3D culture, plated on the surface of a formed gel from which the cells can migrate through the scaffold, or plated on the coatings. Alterations to the strategy presented can impact gelation temperature, strength, or protein fragment sizes. Beyond hydrogel formation, the hydrogel stiffness may be increased using genipin.},

	Abstract = {Cells that line major tissues in the body such as blood vessels{,} lungs and gastrointestinal tract experience deformation from mechanical strain with our heartbeat{,} breathing{,} and other daily activities. Tissues also remodel in both development and disease{,} changing their mechanical properties. Taken together{,} cells can experience vastly different mechanical cues resulting from the combination of these interdependent stimuli. To date{,} most studies of cellular mechanotransduction have been limited to assays in which variations in substrate stiffness and strain were not combined. Here{,} we address this technological gap by implementing a method that can simultaneously tune both substrate stiffness and mechanical strain. Substrate stiffness is controlled with different monomer and crosslinker ratios during polyacrylamide gel polymerization{,} and strain is transferred from the underlying silicone platform when stretched. We demonstrate this platform with polyacrylamide gels with elastic moduli at 6 kPa and 20 kPa in combination with two different silicone formulations. The gels remain attached with up to 50% applied strains. To validate strain transfer through the gels into cells{,} we employ particle-tracking methods and observe strain transmission via cell morphological changes.},

More severe clinical outcomes occur in patients with BMPR2 mutations by-passing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD negative mutations). These comprise 40{\%} of HPAH mutations and are predicted to express BMPR2 mutant products. However expression of endogenous NMD negative BMPR2 mutant products and their effect on protein trafficking and signaling function have never been described. Here, we characterize the expression and trafficking of an HPAH-associated NMD negative BMPR2 mutation that results in an in-frame deletion of BMPR2 EXON2 (BMPR2ΔEx2) in HPAH patient-derived lymphocytes and in pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) from mice carrying the same in-frame deletion of Exon 2 (Bmpr2ΔEx2/+ mice). The endogenous BMPR2ΔEx2 mutant product does not reach the cell surface and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, chemical chaperones 4-PBA and TUDCA partially restore cell surface expression of Bmpr2ΔEx2 in PECs, suggesting that the mutant product is mis-folded. We also show that PECs from Bmpr2ΔEx2/+ mice have defects in the BMP-induced Smad1/5/8 and Id1 signaling axis, and that addition of chemical chaperones restores expression of the Smad1/5/8 target Id1. These data indicate that the endogenous NMD negative BMPRΔEx2 mutant product is expressed but has a folding defect resulting in ER retention. Partial correction of this folding defect and restoration of defective BMP signaling using chemical chaperones suggests that protein-folding agents could be used therapeutically in patients with these NMD negative BMPR2 mutations.},

	Abstract = {The endothelial lining of the vasculature is exposed to a large variety of biochemical and hemodynamic stimuli with different gradients throughout the vascular network. Adequate adaptation requires endothelial cells to be highly plastic, which is reflected by the remarkable heterogeneity of endothelial cells in tissues and organs. Hemodynamic forces such as fluid shear stress and cyclic strain are strong modulators of the endothelial phenotype and function. Although endothelial plasticity is essential during development and adult physiology, proatherogenic stimuli can induce adverse plasticity which contributes to disease. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), the hallmark of endothelial plasticity, was long thought to be restricted to embryonic development but has emerged as a pathologic process in a plethora of diseases. In this perspective we argue how shear stress and cyclic strain can modulate EndMT and discuss how this is reflected in atherosclerosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension.},

@article{Zudaire2011A-Computational,
	Abstract = {Angiogenesis is the generation of mature vascular networks from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis is crucial during the organism' development, for wound healing and for the female reproductive cycle. Several murine experimental systems are well suited for studying developmental and pathological angiogenesis. They include the embryonic hindbrain, the post-natal retina and allantois explants. In these systems vascular networks are visualised by appropriate staining procedures followed by microscopical analysis. Nevertheless, quantitative assessment of angiogenesis is hampered by the lack of readily available, standardized metrics and software analysis tools. Non-automated protocols are being used widely and they are, in general, time - and labour intensive, prone to human error and do not permit computation of complex spatial metrics. We have developed a light-weight, user friendly software, AngioTool, which allows for quick, hands-off and reproducible quantification of vascular networks in microscopic images. AngioTool computes several morphological and spatial parameters including the area covered by a vascular network, the number of vessels, vessel length, vascular density and lacunarity. In addition, AngioTool calculates the so-called ``branching index'' (branch points / unit area), providing a measurement of the sprouting activity of a specimen of interest. We have validated AngioTool using images of embryonic murine hindbrains, post-natal retinas and allantois explants. AngioTool is open source and can be downloaded free of charge.},

@article{Bonvillain2013Nonhuman-Primat,
	Abstract = {There are an insufficient number of lungs available to meet current and future organ transplantation needs. Bioartificial tissue regeneration is an attractive alternative to classic organ transplantation. This technology utilizes an organ's natural biological extracellular matrix (ECM) as a scaffold onto which autologous or stem/progenitor cells may be seeded and cultured in such a way that facilitates regeneration of the original tissue. The natural ECM is isolated by a process called decellularization. Decellularization is accomplished by treating tissues with a series of detergents, salts, and enzymes to achieve effective removal of cellular material while leaving the ECM intact. Studies conducted utilizing decellularization and subsequent recellularization of rodent lungs demonstrated marginal success in generating pulmonary-like tissue which is capable of gas exchange in vivo. While offering essential proof-of-concept, rodent models are not directly translatable to human use. Nonhuman primates (NHP) offer a more suitable model in which to investigate the use of bioartificial organ production for eventual clinical use. The protocols for achieving complete decellularization of lungs acquired from the NHP rhesus macaque are presented. The resulting acellular lungs can be seeded with a variety of cells including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. The manuscript also describes the development of a bioreactor system in which cell-seeded macaque lungs can be cultured under conditions of mechanical stretch and strain provided by negative pressure ventilation as well as pulsatile perfusion through the vasculature; these forces are known to direct differentiation along pulmonary and endothelial lineages, respectively. Representative results of decellularization and cell seeding are provided.},

	Abstract = {All forms of pulmonary hypertension are characterized by structural changes in pulmonary arteries. Increased numbers of cells expressing α-smooth muscle (α-SM) actin is a nearly universal finding in the remodeled artery. Traditionally, it was assumed that resident smooth muscle cells were the exclusive source of these newly appearing α-SM actin-expressing cells. However, rapidly emerging experimental evidence suggests other, alternative cellular sources of these cells. One possibility is that endothelial cells can transition into mesenchymal cells expressing α-SM actin and that this process contributes to the accumulation of SM-like cells in vascular pathologies. We review the evidence that endothelial-mesenchymal transition is an important contributor to cardiac and vascular development as well as to pathophysiological vascular remodeling. Recent work has provided evidence for the role of transforming growth factor-β, Wnt, and Notch signaling in this process. The potential roles of matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteases are also discussed. Importantly, endothelial-mesenchymal transition may be reversible. Thus insights into the mechanisms controlling endothelial-mesenchymal transition are relevant to vascular remodeling and are important as we consider new therapies aimed at reversing pulmonary vascular remodeling.},

@article{Piera-Velazquez2011Role-of-Endothe,
	Abstract = {The accumulation of a large number of myofibroblasts is responsible for exaggerated and uncontrolled production of extracellular matrix during the development and progression of pathological fibrosis. Myofibroblasts in fibrotic tissues are derived from at least three sources: expansion and activation of resident tissue fibroblasts, transition of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT), and tissue migration of bone marrow--derived circulating fibrocytes. Recently, endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), a newly recognized type of cellular transdifferentiation, has emerged as another possible source of tissue myofibroblasts. EndoMT is a complex biological process in which endothelial cells lose their specific markers and acquire a mesenchymal or myofibroblastic phenotype and express mesenchymal cell products such as αsmooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen. Similar to EMT, EndoMT can be induced by transforming growth factor (TGF-β). Recent studies using cell-lineage analysis have demonstrated that EndoMT may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of pulmonary, cardiac, and kidney fibrosis, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for fibrotic disorders.},

	Abstract = {Epithelial injury is a central event in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and fibrotic lung diseases like acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, and iatrogenic lung injury. Mechanical stress is an often underappreciated contributor to lung epithelial injury. Following injury, differentiated epithelia can assume a myofibroblast phenotype in a process termed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to aberrant wound healing and fibrosis. We demonstrate that cyclic mechanical stretch induces EMT in alveolar type II epithelial cells, associated with increased expression of low molecular mass hyaluronan (sHA). We show that sHA is sufficient for induction of EMT in statically cultured alveolar type II epithelial cells and necessary for EMT during cell stretch. Furthermore, stretch-induced EMT requires the innate immune adaptor molecule MyD88. We examined the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which is known to mediate EMT. The Wnt target gene Wnt-inducible signaling protein 1 (wisp-1) is significantly up-regulated in stretched cells in hyaluronan- and MyD88-dependent fashion, and blockade of WISP-1 prevents EMT in stretched cells. In conclusion, we show for the first time that innate immunity transduces mechanical stress responses through the matrix component hyaluronan, and activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.},

	Abstract = {Tissue stiffening is a hallmark of fibrotic disorders but has traditionally been regarded as an outcome of fibrosis, not a contributing factor to pathogenesis. In this study, we show that fibrosis induced by bleomycin injury in the murine lung locally increases median tissue stiffness sixfold relative to normal lung parenchyma. Across this pathophysiological stiffness range, cultured lung fibroblasts transition from a surprisingly quiescent state to progressive increases in proliferation and matrix synthesis, accompanied by coordinated decreases in matrix proteolytic gene expression. Increasing matrix stiffness strongly suppresses fibroblast expression of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) and synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an autocrine inhibitor of fibrogenesis. Exogenous PGE2 or an agonist of the prostanoid EP2 receptor completely counteracts the proliferative and matrix synthetic effects caused by increased stiffness. Together, these results demonstrate a dominant role for normal tissue compliance, acting in part through autocrine PGE2, in maintaining fibroblast quiescence and reveal a feedback relationship between matrix stiffening, COX-2 suppression, and fibroblast activation that promotes and amplifies progressive fibrosis.},

	Abstract = {Neovascularization plays a role in several pathological conditions, including tumor growth, arthritis, and choroidal neovascularization. Investigators from different fields can choose from several available angiogenesis assays according to their specific needs. This chapter describes an easy-to-perform assay that is based on the differentiation of endothelial cells and the formation of tube-like structures on an extracellular matrix, Matrigel. The assay can be used to screen compounds for angiogenic activity or to determine if it has an effect on angiogenesis, depending on the conditions chosen. It is a quick assay, easy to set up, and highly reproducible. It can be used to test one or two samples, or it can quickly be scaled up to screen hundreds of compounds. The flexibility that this assay provides makes it a good first choice to test if a compound or a series of compounds may play a role in angiogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Cells have the ability to actively sense their mechanical environment and respond to both substrate stiffness and stretch by altering their adhesion, proliferation, locomotion, morphology, and synthetic profile. In order to elucidate the interrelated effects of different mechanical stimuli on cell phenotype in vitro, we have developed a method for culturing mammalian cells in a two-dimensional environment at a wide range of combined levels of substrate stiffness and dynamic stretch. Polyacrylamide gels were covalently bonded to flexible silicone culture plates and coated with monomeric collagen for cell adhesion. Substrate stiffness was adjusted from relatively soft (G' = 0.3 kPa) to stiff (G' = 50 kPa) by altering the ratio of acrylamide to bis-acrylamide, and the silicone membranes were stretched over circular loading posts by applying vacuum pressure to impart near-uniform stretch, as confirmed by strain field analysis. As a demonstration of the system, porcine aortic valve interstitial cells (VIC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) were plated on soft and stiff substrates either statically cultured or exposed to 10% equibiaxial or pure uniaxial stretch at 1 Hz for 6 hours. In all cases, cell attachment and cell viability were high. On soft substrates, VICs cultured statically exhibit a small rounded morphology, significantly smaller than on stiff substrates (p<0.05). Following equibiaxial cyclic stretch, VICs spread to the extent of cells cultured on stiff substrates, but did not reorient in response to uniaxial stretch to the extent of cells stretched on stiff substrates. hMSCs exhibited a less pronounced response than VICs, likely due to a lower stiffness threshold for spreading on static gels. These preliminary data demonstrate that inhibition of spreading due to a lack of matrix stiffness surrounding a cell may be overcome by externally applied stretch suggesting similar mechanotransduction mechanisms for sensing stiffness and stretch.},

Clinical trials are evaluating the potential therapeutic use of stem cells in many adult and pediatric lung diseases with vascular component, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Extensive research activity is exploring lung resident and circulating progenitor cells and their contribution to vascular complications of chronic lung diseases, and researchers hope to use resident or circulating stem/progenitor cells to treat chronic lung diseases and their vascular complications. It is becoming more and more clear that progress in mechanobiology will help to understand the various influences of physical forces and extracellular matrix composition on the phenotype and features of the progenitor cells and stem cells. The current review provides an overview of current concepts in the field.},

	Abstract = {Absolute lung volumes such as functional residual capacity, residual volume (RV), and total lung capacity (TLC) are used to characterize emphysema in patients, whereas in animal models of emphysema, the mechanical parameters are invariably obtained as a function of transrespiratory pressure (Prs). The aim of the present study was to establish a link between the mechanical parameters including tissue elastance (H) and airway resistance (Raw), and thoracic gas volume (TGV) in addition to Prs in a mouse model of emphysema. Using low-frequency forced oscillations during slow deep inflation, we tracked H and Raw as functions of TGV and Prs in normal mice and mice treated with porcine pancreatic elastase. The presence of emphysema was confirmed by morphometric analysis of histological slices. The treatment resulted in an increase in TGV by 51 and 44\% and a decrease in H by 57 and 27\%, respectively, at 0 and 20 cmH2O of Prs. The Raw did not differ between the groups at any value of Prs, but it was significantly higher in the treated mice at comparable TGV values. In further groups of mice, tracheal sounds were recorded during inflations from RV to TLC. All lung volumes but RV were significantly elevated in the treated mice, whereas the numbers and size distributions of inspiratory crackles were not different, suggesting that the airways were not affected by the elastase treatment. These findings emphasize the importance of absolute lung volumes and indicate that tissue destruction was not associated with airway dysfunction in this mouse model of emphysema.},

	Abstract = {Globally, respiratory infections cause more than 4 million deaths per year, with influenza and tuberculosis (TB) in particular being major causes of mortality and morbidity. Although immune cell activation is critical for killing respiratory pathogens, this response must be tightly regulated to effectively control and eliminate invading microorganisms while minimizing immunopathology and maintaining pulmonary function. The distinct microenvironment of the lung is constantly patrolled by alveolar macrophages (Mφ), which are essential for tissue homeostasis, early pathogen recognition, initiation of the local immune response, and resolution of inflammation. Here, we focus on recent advances that have provided insight into the relation between pulmonary Mφ, type I interferon (IFN) signaling, and the delicate balance between protective and pathological immune responses in the lung.},

@article{Hsiang2009Interferon-indu,
	Abstract = {The ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein, as well as its conjugating enzymes, is induced by type I interferons (IFNs). Experiments using ISG15 knockout (ISG15(-/-)) mice established that ISG15 and/or its conjugation inhibits the replication of influenza A virus. However, in contrast to the virus inhibition results for mice, the rates of virus replication in ISG15(+/+) and ISG15(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts in tissue culture were similar. Here we focus on human tissue culture cells and on the effect of ISG15 and/or its conjugation on influenza A virus gene expression and replication in such cells. We demonstrate that IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus in human cells is significantly alleviated by inhibiting ISG15 conjugation using small interfering RNAs directed against ISG15-conjugating enzymes. IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus protein synthesis was reduced 5- to 20-fold by suppressing ISG15 conjugation. The amounts of the viral proteins that were restored by these siRNA treatments were approximately 40 to 50% of the amounts produced in cells that were not pretreated with IFN. Further, we show that ISG15 conjugation inhibits influenza A virus replication 10- to 20-fold at early times after infection in human cells. These results show that ISG15 conjugation plays a substantial role in the antiviral state induced by IFN in human cells. In contrast, we show that in mouse embryo fibroblasts ISG15 conjugation not only does not affect influenza A virus replication but also does not contribute to the IFN-induced antiviral activity against influenza A virus gene expression.},

	Abstract = {ISG15, a 15-kDa protein of unique primary amino acid sequence, functions intracellularly as a ubiquitin homologue and a cytokine that induces production of IFN-gamma and augments NK/lymphokine-activated killer cell proliferation and function. ISG15 is secreted from monocytes and lymphocytes, and in this study we have characterized in vitro and in vivo production of ISG15 in response to IFN-alphabeta. Low levels of ISG15 were present constitutively in PBMCs; dose-dependent ISG15 synthesis was observed in response to IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma. High m.w. conjugates, present in PBMC extracts constitutively, were enhanced after IFN-alpha or IFN-beta treatment. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that IFN-beta-induced ISG15 was released from primary cultures of peripheral blood CD3+ (including both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations). Furthermore, ISG15 was released from viable cell lines of monocyte, T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and epithelial origins. Since ISG15 was secreted in response to IFN treatment in vitro, its levels in the serum of healthy human volunteers treated with IFN-beta(ser) were quantitated by asymmetric sandwich ELISA. Both single and multiple doses of IFN-beta(ser) increased serum ISG15 levels significantly (p < 0.01) over baseline. A maximum 7.3-fold enhancement of serum ISG15 was obtained after multiple injections of 8 million units of IFN-beta(ser). Significant change was observed at 24 and 48 h of multiple 0.02-million-unit injections, yielding 1.2- and 1.7-fold increases over basal levels, respectively. These studies suggest that ISG15 is a novel member of the cytokine cascade that is synthesized and released in response to IFN-beta both in vitro and in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The coding sequences of porcine interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG43) were cloned from swine spleen mRNA. The amino acid sequences deduced from porcine ISG15 and ISG43 genes coding sequence shared 24--75{\%} and 29--83{\%} similarity with ISG15s and ISG43s from other vertebrates, respectively. Structural analyses revealed that porcine ISG15 comprises two ubiquitin homologues motifs (UBQ) domain and a conserved C-terminal LRLRGG conjugating motif. Porcine ISG43 contains an ubiquitin-processing proteases-like domain. Phylogenetic analyses showed that porcine ISG15 and ISG43 were mostly related to rat ISG15 and cattle ISG43, respectively. Using quantitative real-time PCR assay, significant increased expression levels of porcine ISG15 and ISG43 genes were detected in porcine kidney endothelial cells (PK15) cells treated with poly I:C. We also observed the enhanced mRNA expression of three members of dsRNA pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), TLR3, DDX58 and IFIH1, which have been reported to act as critical receptors in inducing the mRNA expression of ISG15 and ISG43 genes. However, we did not detect any induced mRNA expression of IFNαand IFNβ, suggesting that transcriptional activations of ISG15 and ISG43 were mediated through IFN-independent signaling pathway in the poly I:C treated PK15 cells. Association analyses in a Landrace pig population revealed that ISG15 c.347T{$>$}C (BstUI) polymorphism and the ISG43 c.953T{$>$}G (BccI) polymorphism were significantly associated with hematological parameters and immune-related traits.},

@article{Escaffre2013Henipavirus-pat,
	Abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are deadly zoonotic viruses for which no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for human use. Henipavirus infection causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis. Although the exact route of transmission in human is unknown, epidemiological studies and in vivo studies suggest that the respiratory tract is important for virus replication. However, the target cells in the respiratory tract are unknown, as are the mechanisms by which henipaviruses can cause disease. In this study, we characterized henipavirus pathogenesis using primary cells derived from the human respiratory tract. The growth kinetics of NiV-Malaysia, NiV-Bangladesh, and HeV were determined in bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (NHBE) and small airway epithelial cells (SAEC). In addition, host responses to infection were assessed by gene expression analysis and immunoassays. Viruses replicated efficiently in both cell types and induced large syncytia. The host response to henipavirus infection in NHBE and SAEC highlighted a difference in the inflammatory response between HeV and NiV strains as well as intrinsic differences in the ability to mount an inflammatory response between NHBE and SAEC. These responses were highest during HeV infection in SAEC, as characterized by the levels of key cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-1alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], and colony-stimulating factors) responsible for immune cell recruitment. Finally, we identified virus strain-dependent variability in type I interferon antagonism in NHBE and SAEC: NiV-Malaysia counteracted this pathway more efficiently than NiV-Bangladesh and HeV. These results provide crucial new information in the understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis in the human respiratory tract at an early stage of infection.},

@article{Dinwiddie2008Human-metapneum,
	Abstract = {The recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of lower and upper respiratory tract infections worldwide. Acute viral infection initiates the interferon response that is critical in mediating viral clearance, viral host defense, and development of adaptive immunity. Mouse models of infection suggest that hMPV can cause persistent lung infections, yet the mechanisms of evading host viral clearance are unknown. Here we report that hMPV can subvert host type I interferon signaling by a mechanism distinct from other paramyxoviruses. Two lung epithelial cell lines and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were permissive for hMPV, consistent with its tropism for the respiratory tract. Treatment of hMPV-infected cells with exogenous IFN-alpha failed to reduce viral replication. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, hMPV infection prevented IFN-alpha-mediated transactivation of the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Further examination of the IFN-alpha signaling cascade showed that hMPV infection prevented IFN-alpha-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1. The inhibitory effects of hMPV on STAT1 phosphorylation and translocation were abolished by ultraviolet inactivation. Regulation of STAT1 by hMPV was specific, as phosphorylation of STAT2, Tyk2, and Jak1 by IFN-alpha and the surface expression of the IFN-alpha receptor were unaltered by hMPV infection. These findings demonstrate that hMPV can inhibit the type I interferon response through regulation of STAT1 phosphorylation, and provide important insight into the viral pathogenesis of hMPV infection in the respiratory tract.},

@article{Bauer2008Cigarette-Smoke,
	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of cigarette smoke on innate antiviral defense mechanisms; specifically, we examined the effects of cigarette smoke on the induction of type I interferon (IFN). We observed a dose-dependent decrease in the ability of human lung fibroblast and epithelial cells to elicit an antiviral response against a viral double-strand RNA (dsRNA) mimic, polyI:C, in the presence of cigarette smoke-conditioned medium (SCM). Mechanistically, SCM decreases the expression of IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and IFN regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) transcripts and suppresses the nuclear translocation of key transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and IRF-3, after polyI:C stimulation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the intercellular defense strategy against viral infection is also impaired. We observed a decrease in the ability of fibroblasts to elicit an antiviral state in response to IFN-beta stimulation. This was associated with decreased nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Stat1 in response to IFN-beta treatment. The effects elicited by SCM are reversible and are almost entirely abrogated in the presence of an antioxidant, such as glutathione. Our findings suggest that cigarette smoke affects the immediate-early, inductive, and amplification phases of the type I IFN response.},

The prevalence of HCV infections varies significantly by race or ethnicity, with a high prevalence of the disease displayed in the Hispanic population. Additionally, Hispanics with chronic HCV have also more advanced hepatic fibrosis and faster liver fibrosis progression rates than either African Americans or Caucasians. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and extent of mortality from liver cirrhosis is also observed in the Hispanic population compared with other groups. Current recommendations for treatment of hepatitis C are interferon alpha (IFNα)-based monotherapy and combination of IFNαpreparations with ribavirin. Future treatment regimens will still be based on IFNαtherapy with or without other effective antiviral agents, currently under investigation. However, there are some inherent limitations, mainly their relative short systemic circulation lifespan, and their unwanted effects on some non-target tissues. New research focuses on the development of novel modified interferon molecules which demonstrate reduced side effects and extended systemic circulation time, which can ultimately provide greater efficacy. Alternative routes for IFNαdelivery, such as oral delivery, demonstrate challenging but promising areas of research for improving future patient compliance.},

@article{Tang2008Simple-and-cost,
	Abstract = {Commercial dry powder dispersers needed in conjunction with particle size measurement equipment are usually quite expensive (of the order of thousands of dollars). We have found that a simple vacuum generator can be used as a cost-effective disperser (US{\$}50). Comparison with other commercial dispersers, small scale powder disperser (SSPD) model 3433 (TSI, Shoreview, USA) and Scirocco dry powder disperser (Malvern, Worcs, UK), showed that our disperser worked as efficiently as these expensive dispersers. Crystalline mannitol (less than 1{\%} moisture content) and amorphous BSA (8.5--9.2{\%} moisture content) smooth spherical particles were used to test the dispersion capability of the unit. Smooth spherical particles were chosen because they are more cohesive than corrugated particles due to increased contact points. Therefore, sufficient dispersions of other less cohesive particles should be able to be achieved using the optimum conditions reported here. The effects of air pressure, sample weight, and nozzle size of the disperser were investigated. Comparison of the particle size distributions between wet and dry measurements were used to determine the dispersion efficiency. Quantitative comparisons were made using the values of D(v,0.5) and span. The best dispersion was found using a 1.00 mm nozzle and the maximum percentage differences in D(v,0.5) and span are 23{\%} and 19{\%}, respectively, with more than 200 mg mannitol powder dispersed with pressures of 50, 70, 90 psi. Using BSA powders, the maximum percentage differences of D(v,0.5) and span are 37{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively. As was the case for the commercial devices, the dispersion of BSA particles could not be improved even when the pressure of the compressed air was increased.},

@article{Srichana1998Dry-powder-inha,
	Abstract = {It is a principal in the formulation of a dry powder aerosol that the device should enable a high fine particle fraction (FPF) of drug to be delivered to the lung whilst any carrier, such as lactose, should remain in the upper airways. Both the device and the dry powder formulation itself contribute to the resultant FPF and few studies have considered the deposition of lactose carrier. It was the purpose of this study to determine the effect of the resistance of the device and the influence of powder formulation on the deposition of drug and carrier. Measurement of the pressure drop across the devices investigated in this study showed that the two types of Inhalator Ingelheim had the highest resistance, whilst lower pressure drops were found across the Diskhaler, Cyclohaler and Accuhaler devices. The lowest pressure drops were measured across the Rotahaler and Spinhaler devices. Employing Rotacaps 400 capsules as the formulated salbutamol product, the FPF of drug was greater from the high resistance devices, being in the order Inhalators Ingelheim{$>$}Cyclohaler{$>$}Rotahaler=Spinhaler. However, the Diskhaler, employing its own developed formulation, produced the highest FPF, approximately twice that from the Accuhaler. There was no statistical difference between the FPF of salbutamol (approximately 20{\%} nominal dose) from the Rotacaps formulation when aerosolised using high resistance devices (Inhalators Ingelheim) operated at 30 l min−1, a medium resistance device (Cyclohaler) operated at 60 l min−1 and low resistance devices (Spinhaler and Rotahaler) operated at a flow-rate of 90 l min−1. The Ventolin Diskhaler using its own formulation operated at 60 l min−1 gave a FPF of 40.33{\%}, but the FPF obtained was sensitive to flow, being only 25.65{\%} of the nominal dose at 30 l min−1. Whereas no lactose was found in the FPF from the Accuhaler operated at 60 l min−1, 100, 400 and 3500 μg were obtained from the Diskhaler, Rotacaps and micronised lactose formulation, respectively, when operated at the same flow-rate. An in-house formulation comprising salbutamol sulphate blended with micronised lactose in a weight ratio of 1:67.5 and aerosolised from a Cyclohaler produced a similar FPF to the Diskhaler at 60 l min−1. When air flow was reduced to 30 l min−1, the FPF from the in-house formulation was reduced considerably less than that from the Diskhaler formulation.},

Absolute pulmonary bioavailabilities were calculated from comparisons of area under the serum concentration curves (AUCs) following intravenous and intratracheal administrations. The presence of peptide in serum was measured by RIA or in the case of interferon with a specific bioassay. By the pulmonary route interferon had an absolute bioavailability > 56{\%}; PTH 84, > 23{\%}; PTH 34, ≈40{\%}; salmon and human calcitonins, ≈17{\%}; glucagon < 1{\%}; and somatostatin < 1{\%}. PTH 34 and the calcitonins peaked in the blood at about 15 min. Interferon had a more continuous and prolonged absorption which was not complete at 9 h. The rather striking permeability of the lung to peptide derivatives and proteins has important implications for the development of new human therapeutics.},

@article{Mcleod2015Optimal-PEGylat,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT The utility of inhaled protein therapeutics to treat lung-resident diseases is limited by protein degradation in the lungs and rapid clearance. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the impact of PEGylation on the lung and systemic exposure of interferon (IFN) α2 after intratracheal administration to rats. An inverse correlation was observed between PEG chain length and systemic exposure, where bioavailability was 5.5% for the 31 kDa PEGylated construct and &lt; 0.4% for the 60 kDa PEGylated construct when compared with 15% for native IFN (19 kDa). Retention of PEGylated IFNα within the lungs increased 2.5-fold to threefold when compared with native IFN. When comparing the lung and systemic exposure of PEGylated and native IFN in terms of protein biological activity, the 31 kDa PEGylated construct increased exposure by 50% and 100%, respectively, when compared with native IFN, but the 60 kDa PEG construct offered no benefit. Preliminary work also indicated that the conjugation of IFNγ with 10 kDa PEG significantly increases the retention of the protein within the lung. Optimal PEGylation may therefore be used as a means to improve the exposure of lung-resident diseases to therapeutic cytokines and potentially reduce systemic exposure and side effects as well as dosing frequency.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The efficacy of pharmaceutical aerosols relates to its deposition in the clinically relevant regions of the lungs, which can be assessed by in vivo lung deposition studies. Dry powder formulations are popular as devices are portable and aerosolisation does not require a propellant. Over the years, key advancements in dry powder formulation, device design and our understanding on the mechanics of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosol have opened up new opportunities in treatment of diseases through pulmonary drug delivery. This review covers these advancements and future directions for inhaled dry powder aerosols.},

@article{LeMessurier2013Type-I-interfer,
	Abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae infection is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Type I interferon (IFN-I), whose contribution to antiviral and intracellular bacterial immunity is well established, is also elicited during pneumococcal infection, yet its functional significance is not well defined. Here, we show that IFN-I plays an important role in the host defense against pneumococci by counteracting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the blood. Mice that lack the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1 (-/-)) or mice that were treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor, exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection, while maintaining comparable bacterial numbers in the lung. In turn, treatment of mice with IFNbeta or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double stranded RNA (poly(I:C)), dramatically reduced the development of bacteremia following intranasal infection with S. pneumoniae. IFNbeta treatment led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of the pneumococcal uptake receptor, platelet activating factor receptor (PAF receptor). In accordance with these findings, IFN-I reduced pneumococcal cell invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers, and Ifnar1 (-/-) mice showed overall enhanced lung permeability. As such, our data identify IFN-I as an important component of the host immune defense that regulates two possible mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion, i.e. PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration, ultimately limiting progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease.},

@article{Zhu2014Human-mesenchym,
	Abstract = {We previously found that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) or its conditioned medium restored lung protein permeability and reduced alveolar inflammation following Escherichia coli endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in an ex vivo perfused human lung in part through the secretion of soluble factors such as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Recently, MSC were found to release microvesicles (MVs) that were biologically active because of the presence of mRNA or miRNA with reparative properties. MVs are circular fragments of membrane released from the endosomal compartment as exosomes or shed from the surface membranes. These studies were designed to determine if MVs released by human bone marrow derived MSCs would be effective in restoring lung protein permeability and reducing inflammation in E. coli endotoxin-induced ALI in C57BL/6 mice. The intratracheal instillation of MVs improved several indices of ALI at 48 hours. Compared to endotoxin-injured mice, MVs reduced extravascular lung water by 43% and reduced total protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid by 35%, demonstrating a reduction in pulmonary edema and lung protein permeability. MVs also reduced the influx of neutrophils and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 levels in the BAL fluid by 73% and 49%, respectively, demonstrating a reduction in inflammation. KGF siRNA-pretreatment of MSC partially eliminated the therapeutic effects of MVs released by MSCs, suggesting that KGF protein expression was important for the underlying mechanism. In summary, human MSC-derived MVs were therapeutically effective following E. coli endotoxin-induced ALI in mice in part through the expression of KGF mRNA in the injured alveolus.},

	Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis refers to a group of lung diseases characterized by inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, and excessive collagen deposition. Although the mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood, current evidence suggests that epithelial injury contributes to the development of fibrosis. Regenerative medicine approaches using extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds have been shown to promote site-specific tissue remodeling. This led to the hypothesis that particulate ECM would promote normal tissue repair and attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. C57BL/6 mice were treated intratracheally with bleomycin or saline with or without a particulate form of ECM scaffold from porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM-ECM) or enzymatically digested UBM-ECM. Mice were sacrificed 5 and 14 days after exposure. Compared to control mice, bleomycin-exposed mice had similar increases in inflammation in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid regardless of UBM-ECM treatment. However, 14 days after exposure, lung histology and collagen levels revealed that mice treated with bleomycin and the particulate or digested UBM-ECM had negligible fibrosis, whereas mice given only bleomycin had marked fibrosis. Administration of the particulate UBM-ECM 24 h after bleomycin exposure also significantly protected against pulmonary injury. In vitro epithelial cell migration and wound healing assays revealed that particulate UBM-ECM promoted epithelial cell chemotaxis and migration. This suggests that promotion of epithelial wound repair may be one mechanism in which UBM-ECM limits pulmonary fibrosis.},

@article{Anderson2006Use-of-Respimat,
	Abstract = {Events of the past decade have stimulated development of new drug formulations and delivery devices that have improved the efficiency, ease of use, and environmental impact of inhaled drug therapy. Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler is a novel, multidose, propellant-free, hand-held, liquid inhaler that represents a new category of inhaler devices. The aerosol cloud generated by Respimat contains a higher fraction of fine particles than most pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and the aerosol spray exits the inhaler more slowly and for a longer duration than with pMDIs. This translates into higher lung drug deposition and lower oropharyngeal deposition, making it possible to give lower nominal doses of delivered drugs without lowering efficacy. In clinical trials in patients with COPD, bronchodilator drugs delivered from Respimat were equally effective at half of the dose delivered from a pMDI. In one study of inhaler preference, Respimat was preferred over the pMDI by patients with COPD and other obstructive lung diseases. Respimat is a valuable addition to the range of inhaler devices available to the patient with COPD.},

@article{Yeh2012Matrix-Stiffnes,
	Abstract = {<p>Endothelial proliferation, which is an important process in vascular homeostasis, can be regulated by the extracellular microenvironment. In this study we demonstrated that proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs) was enhanced on hydrogels with high stiffness (HSG, 21.5 kPa) in comparison to those with low stiffness (LSG, 1.72 kPa). ECs on HSG showed markedly prominent stress fibers and a higher RhoA activity than ECs on LSG. Blockade of RhoA attenuated stress fiber formation and proliferation of ECs on HSG, but had little effect on ECs on LSG; enhancement of RhoA had opposite effects. The phosphorylations of Src and Vav2, which are positive RhoA upstream effectors, were higher in ECs on HSG. The inhibition of Src/Vav2 attenuated the HSG-mediated RhoA activation and EC proliferation but exhibited nominal effects on ECs on LSG. Septin 9 (SEPT9), the negative upstream effector for RhoA, was significantly higher in ECs on LSG. The inhibition of SEPT9 increased RhoA activation, Src/Vav2 phosphorylations, and EC proliferation on LSG, but showed minor effects on ECs on HSG. We further demonstrated that the inactivation of integrin α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> caused an increase of <italic>SEPT9</italic> expression in ECs on HSG to attenuate Src/Vav2 phosphorylations and inhibit RhoA-dependent EC proliferation. These results demonstrate that the SEPT9/Src/Vav2/RhoA pathway constitutes an important molecular mechanism for the mechanical regulation of EC proliferation.</p>},

	Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a highly heterogeneous and lethal pathological process with limited therapeutic options. Although research on the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis has frequently focused on the mechanisms that regulate the proliferation, activation, and differentiation of collagen-secreting myofibroblasts, recent studies have identified new pathogenic mechanisms that are critically involved in the initiation and progression of fibrosis in a variety of settings. A more detailed and integrated understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis could help pave the way for effective therapeutics for this devastating and complex disease.},

	Abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant activation of alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts in an aging lung plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the biopathological processes linking aging with IPF and the mechanisms responsible for the abnormal activation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts have not been elucidated. Many of the hallmarks of aging (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence) have been proposed as essential mechanisms for the development of IPF; however, these disturbances are not restricted to IPF and also occur in other aging-related lung disorders, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, an unanswered question is why a current/former smoker of about 60 years of age with shorter telomeres, alveolar epithelial senescence, excessive oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction develops IPF and not COPD; in other words, what makes old lungs specifically susceptible to develop IPF? In this Perspective, we propose an integral model in which the combination of some gene variants and/or gene expression in the aging lung results in the loss of epithelial integrity and consequently in the failure of the alveoli to correctly respond to injury and to face the stress associated with mechanical stretch. Afterward, a distinctive epigenetic "reprogramming" that affects both epithelial cells and fibroblasts provokes, among others, the recapitulation of developmental pathways and the aberrant activation and miscommunication between both cell types, resulting in the exaggerated production and accumulation of extracellular matrix and the subsequent destruction of the lung architecture.},

@article{ONeill2013Decellularizati,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure is orthotopic transplantation. Lung extracellular matrix (LECM) holds great potential as a scaffold for lung tissue engineering because it retains the complex architecture, biomechanics, and topologic specificity of the lung. Decellularization of human lungs rejected from transplantation could provide "ideal" biologic scaffolds for lung tissue engineering, but the availability of such lungs remains limited. The present study was designed to determine whether porcine lung could serve as a suitable substitute for human lung to study tissue engineering therapies. METHODS: Human and porcine lungs were procured, sliced into sheets, and decellularized by three different methods. Compositional, ultrastructural, and biomechanical changes to the LECM were characterized. The suitability of LECM for cellular repopulation was evaluated by assessing the viability, growth, and metabolic activity of human lung fibroblasts, human small airway epithelial cells, and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells over a period of 7 days. RESULTS: Decellularization with 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) showed the best maintenance of both human and porcine LECM, with similar retention of LECM proteins except for elastin. Human and porcine LECM supported the cultivation of pulmonary cells in a similar way, except that the human LECM was stiffer and resulted in higher metabolic activity of the cells than porcine LECM. CONCLUSIONS: Porcine lungs can be decellularized with CHAPS to produce LECM scaffolds with properties resembling those of human lungs, for pulmonary tissue engineering. We propose that porcine LECM can be an excellent screening platform for the envisioned human tissue engineering applications of decellularized lungs.},

@article{Booth2012Acellular-Norma,
	Abstract = {Rationale: Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic tissue that contributes to organ integrity and function, and its regulation of cell phenotype is a major aspect of cell biology. However, standard in vitro culture approaches are of unclear physiologic relevance because they do not mimic the compositional, architectural, or distensible nature of a living organ. In the lung, fibroblasts exist in ECM-rich interstitial spaces and are key effectors of lung fibrogenesis. Objectives: To better address how ECM influences fibroblast phenotype in a disease-specific manner, we developed a culture system using acellular human normal and fibrotic lungs.

Methods: Decellularization was achieved using treatment with detergents, salts, and DNase. The resultant matrices can be sectioned as uniform slices within which cells were cultured.

Measurements and Main Results: We report that the decellularization process effectively removes cellular and nuclear material while retaining native dimensionality and stiffness of lung tissue. We demonstrate that lung fibroblasts reseeded into acellular lung matrices can be subsequently assayed using conventional protocols; in this mannerwe show that fibrotic matrices clearly promote transforming growth factor-b--independent myofibroblast differentiation compared with normal matrices. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis of acellular matrix ECM details significant compositional differences between normal and fibrotic lungs, paving the way for further study of novel hypotheses.

Conclusions: This methodology is expected to allow investigation of important ECM-based hypotheses in human tissues and permits future scientific exploration in an organ- and disease-specific manner.},

	Abstract = {This study attempted to use collagen-Matrigel as extracellular matrix (ECM) to supply cells with three-dimensional (3D) culture condition and employ alginate-poly-l-lysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules to control the formation of alveolus-like structure in vitro. We tested mice foetal pulmonary cells (FPCs) by immunohistochemistry after 2D culture. The alveolus-like structure was reconstructed by seeding FPCs in collagen-Matrigel mixed with APA microcapsules 1.5 ml. A self-made mould was used to keep the structure from contraction. Meanwhile, it provided static stretch to the structure. After 7, 14 and 21 days of culture, the alveolus-like structure was analysed histologically and immunohistochemically, or by scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We also observed these structures under inverted phase contrast microscope. The expression of pro-surfactant protein C (SpC) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We obtained fibroblasts, epithelial cells and alveolar type II (AE2) cells in FPCs. In the reconstructed structure, seeding cells surrounding the APA microcapsules constructed alveolus-like structures, the size of them ranges from 200 to 300 mum. In each reconstructed lung tissue sheet, microcapsules had integrity. Pan-cytokeratin, vimentin and SpC positive cells were observed in 7- and 14-day cultured structures. TEM showed lamellar bodies of AE2 cells in the reconstructed tissues whereas RT-PCR expressed SpC gene. Primary mice FPCs could form alveolus-like structures in collagen-Matrigel/APA microcapsules engineered scaffolds, which could maintain a differentiated state of AE2 cells.},

@article{Hamed2014Synthetic-trach,
	Abstract = {In this study, the development of a model tracheal mucus with chemical composition and physical properties (bulk viscoelasticity and surface tension) matched to that of native tracheal mucus is described. The mucus mimetics (MMs) were formulated using components that are abundant in tracheal mucus (glycoproteins, proteins, lipids, ions, and water) at concentrations similar to those found natively. Pure solutions were unable to achieve the gel behavior observed with native mucus. The addition of a bifunctional cross-linking agent enabled control over the viscoelastic properties of the MMs by tailoring the concentration of the cross-linking agent and the duration of cross-linking. Three MM formulations with different bulk viscoelastic properties, all within the normal range for nondiseased tracheal mucus, were chosen for investigation of surfactant spreading at the air--mimetic interface. Surfactant spread quickly and completely on the least viscoelastic mimetic surface, enabling the surface tension of the mimetic to be lowered to match native tracheal mucus. However, surfactant spreading on the more viscoelastic mimetics was hindered, suggesting that the bulk properties of the mimetics dictate the range of surface properties that can be achieved. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Metwalli2006Surface-charact,
	Abstract = {The surface properties and structure of mono-, di-, and tri-aminosilane treated glass surfaces were investigated using surface analytical techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and streaming potential. An optimized dip-coating process was demonstrated to produce roughly silane monolayer coverage on the glass surface. The surface charge measurements indicated that aminosilanization converts the glass surface from negative to positive potentials at neutral pH values. Higher positive streaming potential was observed for tri-compared with mono- and di-aminosilane treated glass surfaces. For all aminosilane treated glass samples, the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra indicated a preferential orientation of the protonated amino-groups towards the glass surface whereas the free amino groups were protruding outward. This study aimed to obtain uniform, reproducibly thin, strongly adhering, internally cross-linked, and high positively charged aminosilane-coated glass surfaces for the attachment of DNA fragments used in microarraying experiments.},

	Abstract = {The development of environmentally responsive drug carriers requires new methods for assembling stimuli-responsive nanoparticulates. This communication describes a novel application of electrospray to construct bioresponsive peptide-based particulates, which can encapsulate drugs. These particles are composed from genetically engineered elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), a biodegradable, biocompatible, and bioresponsive polymer. To generate nanoparticles (300−400 nm in diameter), ELPs and drugs are codissolved in organic solvent, accelerated across a voltage gradient, dried by evaporation during transit, and collected from a target surface. These findings indicate that particle diameter, polydispersity, and morphology are strong functions of the solvent concentration, spraying voltage, and polymer molecular weight. Surprisingly, the loading of drug at 20 w/w{\%} did not influence particle morphology; furthermore, drug release from these particles correlated with the pH-dependent solubility of the parent ELPs. These studies suggest that electrospray is an efficient and flexible method for generating stimuli-responsive drug particles.},

	Abstract = { Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are characterized by a high sequence control, temperature responsiveness and biocompatibility, which make them highly interesting as smart materials for application in nanomedicine. In particular the construction of ELP-based nanoparticles has recently become a focal point of attention in materials research. This review will give an overview of the ELP-based nanoparticles that have been developed until now and their underlying design principles. First a short introduction on ELPs and their stimulus-responsive behavior will be given. This characteristic has been applied for the development of ELP-based block copolymers that can self-assemble into nanoparticles. Both the fully ELP-based as well as several ELP hybrid materials that have been reported to form nanoparticles will be discussed, which is followed by a concise description of the promising biomedical applications reported for this class of materials. },

Advances in materials chemistry, materials fabrication and processing technologies, and developmental biology have led to the design of 3D cell culture matrices that better represent the geometry, chemistry, and signaling environment of natural extracellular matrix. In this review, we present the status of state-of-the-art 3D cell-growth techniques and scaffolds and analyze them from the perspective of materials properties, manufacturing, and functionality. Particular emphasis was placed on tissue engineering and in vitro modeling of human organs, where we see exceptionally strong potential for 3D scaffolds and cell-growth methods. We also outline key challenges in this field and most likely directions for future development of 3D cell culture over the period of 5-10 years.},

	Abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common lung diseases worldwide, and is characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible with treatment. Even though airflow obstruction is caused by airway smooth muscle contraction, the extent of airway narrowing depends on a range of other structural and functional determinants that impact on active and passive tissue mechanics. Cells and extracellular matrix in the airway and parenchymal compartments respond both passively and actively to the mechanical stimulation induced by smooth muscle contraction. In this review, we summarize the factors that regulate airway narrowing and provide insight into the relative contributions of different constituents of the extracellular matrix and their biomechanical impact on airway obstruction. We then review the changes in extracellular matrix composition in the airway and parenchymal compartments at different stages of COPD, and finally discuss how these changes impact airway narrowing and the development of airway hyperresponsiveness. Finally, we position these data in the context of therapeutic research focused on defective tissue repair. As a conclusion, we propose that future works should primarily target mild or early COPD, prior to the widespread structural changes in the alveolar compartment that are more characteristic of severe COPD.},

@article{Hussey2002Outpatient-cost,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outpatient costs of medications prescribed for chronic heart failure are high and are often borne by individual patients. Lack of financial resources may force noncompliance with use of medications. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outpatient costs of medications for patients with different New York Heart Association classifications of chronic heart failure. METHODS: The charts of 138 patients with chronic heart failure were reviewed retrospectively. Outpatient costs of medications were obtained from the Web sites of commercial pharmacies. Medications were classified by type according to the system of the American Heart Association. A mean cost for each classification of medication was used for analysis. RESULTS: The overall mean monthly cost of medications for chronic heart failure was $438. Patients with class II and class III chronic heart failure had the highest costs: $541 and $514, respectively. Analysis of variance indicated that the differences in monthly costs of medications between the patients with the 4 stages of chronic heart failure were significant (F = 4.86, P = .003). A post hoc Scheffe test revealed significant differences in costs between patients with class I and patients with class II heart failure (P = .02) and between patients with class I and those with class III heart failure (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The outpatient costs of medications for chronic heart failure are significant. Ability to pay for prescribed medications must be determined. Healthcare professionals must maintain an awareness of the costs of medications and patients' ability to pay.},

	N2 = {Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), during which endothelial cells (ECs) transdifferentiate into mesenchymal phenotype, plays a key role in the development of vascular implant complications such as endothelium dysfunction and in-stent restenosis. Substrate stiffness has been confirmed as a key factor to influence EC behaviors; however, so far, the relationship between substrate stiffness and EndMT has been rarely studied. Here, ECs were cultured on the (poly(l-lysine)/hyaluronate acid) (PLL/HA) multilayer films with controlled stiffness for 2 weeks, and their EndMT behaviors were studied. We demonstrated that ECs lost their markers (vWf and CD31) in a stiffness-dependent manner even without supplement of growth factors, and the softer film favored the maintaining of EC phenotype. Further, induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), ECs underwent EndMT, as characterized by losing their typical cobblestone morphology and markers and gaining smooth muscle cell markers (α-smooth muscle actin and calponin). Interestingly, stronger EndMT was observed when ECs were cultured on the stiffer film. Collectively, our findings suggest that substrate stiffness has significant effects on EndMT, and a softer substrate is beneficial to ECs by keeping their phenotype and inhibiting EndMT, which presents a new strategy for surface design of vascular implant materials.},

@article{Conti2004Defects-in-cell,
	Abstract = {Previous work has shown that ablation or mutation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-B (NMHC II-B) in mice results in defects in the heart and brain with death occurring between embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and birth (Tullio, A. N., Accili, D., Ferrans, V. J., Yu, Z. X., Takeda, K., Grinberg, A., Westphal, H., Preston, Y. A., and Adelstein, R. S. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 12407-12412). Here we show that mice ablated for NMHC II-A fail to develop a normal patterned embryo with a polarized visceral endoderm by E6.5 and die by E7.5. Moreover, A(-)/A(-) embryoid bodies grown in suspension culture constantly shed cells. These defects in cell adhesion and tissue organization are explained by loss of E-cadherin and beta-catenin localization to cell adhesion sites in both cell culture and in the intact embryos. The defects can be reproduced by introducing siRNA directed against NMHC II-A into wild-type embryonic stem cells. Our results suggest an essential role for a single, specific nonmuscle myosin isoform in maintaining cell-cell adhesions in the early mammalian embryo.},

A logical solution is to use multipotent progenitor cells, which in vascular treatments have been underutilized. Although biochemical stimulation has been explored to differentiate bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMPCs) to smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the use of biomechanical forces in differentiation remains unexplored. The purpose of this work was to explore the effects of cyclic strain alone on BMPC morphology, proliferation, and differentiation. BMPCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and, after 7 days in culture, the cells grew in distinct multilayered colonies. BMPCs were stimulated with 10{\%} strain at 1 Hz for 7 days. Observations showed that cyclic strain inhibited proliferation (p < 0.05) and caused alignment of the cells (p < 0.05) and of the F-actin cytoskeleton perpendicular to the direction of strain. In addition, cyclic strain resulted in expression by the cells of vascular smooth muscle alpha-actin and h1-calponin. This work demonstrates the potential of physiologic biomechanical stimulation in the differentiation of BMPCs to SMCs, and this could have important implications for vascular tissue engineering and other therapies in which cell sourcing is a major concern.},

@article{Yamamoto2005Fluid-shear-str,
	Abstract = {Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells are capable of differentiating into all cell lineages, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate ES cell differentiation have not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we report that shear stress, a mechanical force generated by fluid flow, can induce ES cell differentiation. When Flk-1-positive (Flk-1(+)) mouse ES cells were subjected to shear stress, their cell density increased markedly, and a larger percentage of the cells were in the S and G(2)-M phases of the cell cycle than Flk-1(+) ES cells cultured under static conditions. Shear stress significantly increased the expression of the vascular endothelial cell-specific markers Flk-1, Flt-1, vascular endothelial cadherin, and PECAM-1 at both the protein level and the mRNA level, but it had no effect on expression of the mural cell marker smooth muscle alpha-actin, blood cell marker CD3, or the epithelial cell marker keratin. These findings indicate that shear stress selectively promotes the differentiation of Flk-1(+) ES cells into the endothelial cell lineage. The shear stressed Flk-1(+) ES cells formed tubelike structures in collagen gel and developed an extensive tubular network significantly faster than the static controls. Shear stress induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Flk-1 in Flk-1(+) ES cells that was blocked by a Flk-1 kinase inhibitor, SU1498, but not by a neutralizing antibody against VEGF. SU1498 also abolished the shear stress-induced proliferation and differentiation of Flk-1(+) ES cells, indicating that a ligand-independent activation of Flk-1 plays an important role in the shear stress-mediated proliferation and differentiation by Flk-1(+) ES cells.},

To do this EPCs must break down ECM, migrate and undergo tube morphogenesis
ECM provides biochemical and biophysical cues to regulate
Postnatal neovasculogenesis due to EPCs from bone marrow
ECM increases integrins -> regulate shape, and cytoskeletal structure
Mechanical forces exerted by ECs stimulate capillary growth
Matrix elasticity regulates VEGFR2
READ FOLKMAN AND HAUDENSCHILD
Intracellular vacuoles extend due to integrin-ECM signalling interactions mediated through Rho GTPase, CDC42,

	cd45 (Protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C - on all hematopoietic cells) cd14 (macrophages) --- negative

Pooled multiple patients together

used HA-gelatin hydrogel with PEGDA crosslinker

E=3G' because assume incompressible and poisson = 0.5

only used G' of 3.3, 25, ~215 - similar results we have 0.4-1 kPa are ideal vascular stiffnesses

Stiffness increases MT1-MMP, MMP-1, MMP-2

ECM mechanics chand growth factor availability

Reduced tension is sufficient to trigger tubulogenesis

VEGF induces MMP production, allowing EPCs to migrate - co-regulated by matrix stiffness
	Stiffer matrix = more MMPs
	Reduced elasticity promotes tubulogenesis

Previously shown that MT1-MMP degrades ECM and creates potential space for tubulogenesis

They show that it is co-regulated by stiffness and VEGF

MT1-MMP knockdown did not allow for Capillary like structures formation},

	Abstract = {Tissue engineered therapies are emerging as solutions to several of the medical challenges facing aging societies. To this end, a fundamental research goal is the development of novel biocompatible materials and scaffolds. Self-assembling peptides are materials that have undergone rapid development in the last two decades and they hold promise in meeting some of these challenges. Using amino acids as building blocks enables a great versatility to be incorporated into the structures that peptides form, their physical properties and their interactions with biological systems. This review discusses several classes of short self-assembling sequences, explaining the principles that drive their self-assembly into structures with nanoscale ordering, and highlighting in vitro and in vivo studies that demonstrate the potential of these materials as novel soft tissue engineering scaffolds.},

In this study, two poly (alpha-hydroxy) esters were formulated with Aerosol-OT, a surfactant stabilizer, to encapsulate the protein keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) for controlled release KGF is involved in a number of crucial biologic processes, most notably epithelial growth and repair. The concentration of KGF that caused a biological response in vitro was determined (optimally 10 ng/mL) and compared with the release of KGF from the two biodegradable polymer membrane formulations. Each polymer formulation released biologically relevant levels, 10 ng/mL of active KGF, although with different times release kinetics. The membrane composed of PLGA/AOT/KGF exhibited a faster release rate of KGF into solution after 120 h of degradation time than the release rate of the PLLA/AOT/KGF matrices. Cell seeding assays showed that both polymer matrices, when formulated with AOT, sustained cell growth. Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was used to characterize the distribution of AOT and KGF through the polymer membrane. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {We describe the structural and functional properties of three-dimensional (3D) nerve guides fabricated from poly - caprolactone (PCL) using the air gap electrospinning process. This process makes it possible to deposit nano-to-micron diameter fibers into linear bundles that are aligned in parallel with the long axis of a cylindrical construct. By varying starting electrospinning conditions it is possible to modulate scaffold material properties and void space volume. The architecture of these constructs provides thousands of potential channels to direct axon growth. In cell culture functional assays, scaffolds composed of individual PCL fibers ranging from 400 to 1500 nm supported the penetration and growth of axons from rat dorsal root ganglion. To test the efficacy of our guide design we reconstructed 10 mm lesions in the rodent sciatic nerve with scaffolds that had fibers 1 ??m in average diameter and void volumes {\textgreater}90{\{}{\%}{\}}. Seven weeks post implantation, microscopic examination of the regenerating tissue revealed dense, parallel arrays of myelinated and non-myelinated axons. Functional blood vessels were scattered throughout the implant. We speculate that end organ targeting might be improved in nerve injuries if axons can be directed to regenerate along specific tissue planes by a guide composed of 3D fiber arrays. ?? 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

@article{Au2015Improving-Cance,
	Abstract = {Combining molecularly targeted agents and chemotherapeutics is an emerging strategy in cancer treatment. We engineered sub-50 nm diameter di-block copolymer nanoparticles (NPs) that can sequentially release wortmannin (Wtmn, a cell signaling inhibitor) and docetaxel (Dtxl, genotoxic anticancer agent) to cancer cells. These NPs were studied in chemoradiotherapy, an important cancer treatment paradigm, in the preclinical setting. We demonstrated that Wtmn enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Dtxl and increased the efficiency of radiotherapy (XRT) in H460 lung cancer and PC3 prostate cells in culture. Importantly, we showed that NPs containing both Wtmn and Dtxl release the drugs in a desirable sequential fashion to therapeutic efficacy in comparison to administering each drug alone. An in vivo toxicity study in a murine model validated that NPs containing both Dtxl and Wtmn do not have a high toxicity profile. Lastly, we demonstrated that Dtxl/Wtmn co-encapsulated NPs are more efficient than each single drug loaded NPs or combination of both single drug loaded NPs in chemoradiotherapy using xenograft models. Histopathological studies and correlative studies support that the improved therapeutic efficacy is through changes in signaling pathways (Wtmn) and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Our findings suggest that our nanoparticle system led to a dynamic rewiring of cellular apoptotic pathways and thus a higher therapeutic efficiency.},

@article{Adwan2012Modifying-three,
	Abstract = {Background: Although hepatocytes have a remarkable regenerative power, the rapidity of acute liver failure makes liver transplantation the only definitive treatment. Attempts to incorporate engineered three-dimensional liver tissue in bioartificial liver devices or in implantable tissue constructs, to treat or bridge patients to self-recovery, were met with many challenges, amongst which is to find suitable polymeric matrices. We studied the feasibility of utilising nanocomposite polymers in three-dimensional scaffolds for hepatocytes.
Materials and methods: Hepatocytes (HepG2) were seeded on a flat sheet and in three-dimensional scaffolds made of a nanocomposite polymer (Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane [POSS]-modified polycaprolactone urea urethane) alone as well as with porogen particles, i.e. glucose, sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride. The scaffold architecture, cell attachment and morphology were studied with scanning electron microscopy, and we assessed cell viability and functionality.
Results: Cell attachment to the scaffolds was demonstrated. The scaffold made with glucose particles as porogen showed a narrower range of pore size with higher porosity and better inter-pore communications and seemed to encourage near normal cell morphology. There was a steady increase of albumin secretion throughout the experiment while the control (monolayer cell culture) showed a steep decrease after day 7. At the end of the experiment, there was no significant difference in viability and functionality between the scaffolds and the control.
Conclusion: In this initial study, porogen particles were used to modify the scaffolds produced from the novel polymer. Although there was no significance against the control in functionality and viability, the demonstrable attachment on scanning electron microscopy suggest potential roles for this polymer and in particular for scaffolds made with glucose particles in liver tissue engineering.},

	Abstract = {An inherent difficulty associated with the application of suitable bioscaffolds for tissue engineering is the incorporation of adequate mechanical characteristics into the materials which recapitulate that of the native tissue, whilst maintaining cell proliferation and nutrient transfer qualities. Biomaterial composites fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques can potentially improve the functionality and patient-specific processing of tissue engineering scaffolds. In this work, a technique for the coaxial melt extrusion printing of core-shell scaffold structures was designed, implemented and assessed with respect to the repeatability, cell efficacy and scaffold porosity obtainable. Encapsulated alginate hydrogel/thermoplastic polycaprolactone (Alg-PCL) cofibre scaffolds were fabricated. Selective laser melting was used to produce a high resolution stainless steel 316 L coaxial extrusion nozzle, exhibiting diameters of 300 $\mu$m/900 $\mu$m for the inner and outer nozzles respectively. We present coaxial melt extrusion printed scaffolds of Alg-PCL cofibres with {\~{}}0.4 volume fraction alginate, with total fibre diameter as low as 600 $\mu$m and core material offset as low as 10{\{}{\%}{\}} of the total diameter. Furthermore the tuneability of scaffold porosity, pore size and interconnectivity, as well as the preliminary inclusion, compatibility and survival of an L-929 mouse fibroblast cell-line within the scaffolds were explored. This preliminary cell work highlighted the need for optimal material selection and further design reiteration in future research.},

@article{Chen2013Keratinocyte-gr,
	Abstract = {Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with high morbidity and mortality, and have no specific therapy. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a critical factor for pulmonary epithelial repair and acts via the stimulation of epithelial cell proliferation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proved as good therapeutic vectors. Thus, we hypothesized that MSC-based KGF gene therapy would have beneficial effects on lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced lung injury. After two hours of intratracheal LPS administration to induce lung injury, mice received saline, MSCs alone, empty vector-engineered MSCs (MSCs-vec) or KGF-engineered MSCs (MSCs-kgf) via the tail vein. The MSCs-kgf could be detected in the recipient lungs and the level of KGF expression significantly increased in the MSCs-kgf mice. The MSC-mediated administration of KGF not only improved pulmonary microvascular permeability but also mediated a down-regulation of proinflammatory responses (reducing IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$) and an up-regulation of anti-inflammatory responses (increasing cytokine IL-10). Furthermore, the total severity scores of lung injury were significantly reduced in the MSCs-kgf group compared with the other three groups. The underlying mechanism of the protective effect of KGF on ALI may be attributed to the promotion of type II lung epithelial cell proliferation and the enhancement of surfactant synthesis. These findings suggest that MSCs-based KGF gene therapy may be a promising strategy for ALI treatment.},

	Abstract = {The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESC) is offering new opportunities in tissue engineering and cell therapy. We have shown previously that alveolar epithelial cells, specifically type II pneumocytes, can be derived from murine ESC and hypothesized that a similar protocol could be used successfully on human ESC. Undifferentiated human ESC were induced to form embryoid bodies that were transferred into adherent culture conditions and grown in a medium designed for the maintenance of mature small airway epithelium. On inverted microscopy, the generated cells showed the cobblestone-like morphology of epithelium. The presence of surfactant protein C, a specific marker of type II pneumocytes, and its corresponding RNA were demonstrated by immunostaining and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Electron microscopy revealed frequent cells with the typical ultrastructure of type II pneumocytes. This study provides evidence for in vitro induction of the differentiation from human ESC of alveolar type II cells, which have the potential for therapeutic use or construction of an in vitro model of human lung.},

	Abstract = {The adult liver is wrapped in a connective tissue sheet called the liver capsule, which consists of collagen fibrils and fibroblasts. In this study, we set out to construct a liver organoid tissue that would be comparable to the endogenous liver, using a bioreactor. In vitro liver organoid tissue was generated by combining collagen fibrils, fibroblasts, and primary murine hepatocytes or Hep G2 on a mesh of poly-lactic acid fabric using a bioreactor. Then, the suitability of this liver organoid tissue for transplantation was tested by implanting the constructs into partially hepatectomized BALB/cA-nu/nu mice. As determined by using scanning and transmission electron microscopes, the liver organoid tissues were composed of densely packed collagen fibrils with fibroblasts and aggregates of oval or spherical hepatocytes. Angiogenesis was induced after the transplantation, and blood vessels connected the liver organoid tissue with the surrounding tissue. Thus, a novel approach was applied to generate transplantable liver organoid tissue within a condensed collagen fibril matrix. These results suggested that a dense collagen network populated with fibroblasts can hold a layer of concentrated hepatocytes, providing a three-dimensional microenvrionment suitable for the reestablishment of cell--cell and cell--extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, and resulting in the maintenance of their liver-specific functions. This liver organoid tissue may be useful for the study of intrahepatic functions of various cells, cytokines, and ECMs, and may fulfill the fundamental requirements of a donor tissue.},

	Abstract = {Current cardiovascular therapies are limited by the loss of endothelium, restenosis and thrombosis. The goal of this study was to develop a biomimetic hybrid nanomatrix that combined the unique properties of electrospun polycaprolactone (ePCL) nanofibers with self-assembled peptide amphiphiles (PAs). ePCL nanofibers have interconnected nanoporous structures, but are hampered by a lack of surface bioactivity to control cellular behavior. It has been hypothesized that PAs could self-assemble onto the surface of ePCL nanofibers and endow them with the characteristic properties of native endothelium. The PAs, which comprised hydrophobic alkyl tails attached to functional hydrophilic peptide sequences, contained enzyme-mediated degradable sites coupled to either endothelial cell-adhesive ligands (YIGSR) or polylysine (KKKKK) nitric oxide (NO) donors. Two different PAs (PA-YIGSR and PA-KKKKK) were successfully synthesized and mixed in a 90:10 (YK) ratio to obtain PA-YK. PA-YK was reacted with pure NO to develop PA-YK-NO, which was then self-assembled onto ePCL nanofibers to generate a hybrid nanomatrix, ePCL-PA-YK-NO. Uniform coating of self-assembled PA nanofibers on ePCL was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Successful NO release from ePCL-PA-YK-NO was observed. ePCL-YK and ePCL-PA-YK-NO showed significantly increased adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). ePCL-PA-YK-NO also showed significantly increased proliferation of HUVECs and reduced smooth muscle cell proliferation. ePCL-PA-YK-NO also displayed significantly reduced platelet adhesion compared with ePCL, ePCL-PA-YK and a collagen control. These results indicate that this hybrid nanomatrix has great potential application in cardiovascular implants. ?? 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Particulate systems like nanoparticles have been used as a physical approach to alter and improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of various types of drug molecules. They have been used in vivo to protect the drug entity in the systemic circulation, restrict access of the drug to the chosen sites and to deliver the drug at a controlled and sustained rate to the site of action. Various polymers have been used in the formulation of nanoparticles for drug delivery research to increase therapeutic benefit, while minimizing side effects.

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Recent studies have suggested that both embryonic stem cells and adult bone marrow stem cells can participate in the regeneration and repair of diseased adult organs, including the lungs. However, the extent of airway epithelial remodeling with adult marrow stem cells is low, and there are no available in vivo data with embryonic stem cells. Human umbilical cord blood contains both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic stem cells, which have been used clinically as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies and other diseases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that human umbilical cord blood stem cells might be an effective alternative to adult bone marrow and embryonic stem cells for regeneration and repair of injured airway epithelium.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Human cord blood was obtained from normal deliveries at the University of Vermont. Cultured plastic adherent cells were characterized as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by flow cytometry and differentiation assays. Cord blood-derived MSCs (CB-MSCs) were cultured in specialized airway growth media or with specific growth factors, including keratinocyte growth factor and retinoic acid. mRNA and protein expression were analyzed with PCR and immunofluorescent staining. CB-MSCs were systematically administered to immunotolerant, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice. Lungs were analyzed for presence of human cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When cultured in specialized airway growth media or with specific growth factors, CB-MSCs differentially expressed Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), surfactant protein C, and thyroid transcription factor-1 mRNA, and CCSP and CFTR protein. Furthermore, CB-MSCs were easily transduced with recombinant lentiviral vectors to express human CFTR. After systemic administration to immunotolerant, NOD-SCID, mice, rare cells were found in the airway epithelium that had acquired cytokeratin and human CFTR expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: CB-MSCs appear to be comparable to MSCs obtained from adult bone marrow in ability to express phenotypic markers of airway epithelium and to participate in airway remodeling in vivo.},

	Abstract = {We have shown that intermittent mechanical strain, simulating fetal breathing movements, stimulated fetal rat lung cell proliferation. Because normal lung growth requires proper coordination between cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, we investigated the effect of strain on fibronectin metabolism. Organotypic cultures of fetal rat lung cells, subjected to intermittent strain, showed increased fibronectin content in the culture media. Fibronectin-degrading activity in media from strained cells was similar to that of static cultures. Northern analysis revealed that strain inhibited fibronectin mRNA accumulation seen during static culture. Synthesis of fibronectin, determined by metabolic labeling, was increased by strain despite lower mRNA levels or presence of actinomycin D. This increase was not mediated via a rapamycin-sensitive mechanism. Strain stimulated prelabeled fibronectin secretion even in the presence of cycloheximide. These results suggest that strain differentially regulates fibronectin production of fetal lung cells at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Mechanical strain increases soluble fibronectin content by stimulating its synthesis and secretion without increasing fibronectin message levels.},

@article{Lu2014Pancreatic-stel,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) promote metastasis as well as local growth of pancreatic cancer. However, the factors mediating the effect of PSCs on pancreatic cancer cells have not been clearly identified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used a modified Boyden chamber assay as an in vitro model to investigate the role of PSCs in migration of Panc1 and UlaPaCa cells and to identify the underlying mechanisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PSC supernatant (PSC-SN) dose-dependently induced the trans-migration of Panc1 and UlaPaCa cells, mainly via haptokinesis and haptotaxis, respectively. In contrast to poly-L-lysine or fibronectin, collagen I resembled PSC-SN with respect to its effect on cancer cell behaviours, including polarised morphology, facilitated adhesion, accelerated motility and stimulated trans-migration. Blocking antibodies against integrin $\alpha$2/$\beta$1 subunits significantly attenuated PSC-SN- or collagen I-promoted cell trans-migration and adhesion. Moreover, both PSC-SN and collagen I induced the formation of F-actin and focal adhesions in cells, which was consistent with the constantly enhanced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK, Tyr397). Inhibition of FAK function by an inhibitor or small interference RNAs significantly diminished the effect of PSC-SN or collagen I on haptotaxis/haptokinesis of pancreatic cancer cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Collagen I is the major mediator for PSC-SN-induced haptokinesis of Panc1 and haptotaxis of UlaPaCa by activating FAK signalling via binding to integrin $\alpha$2$\beta$1.},

@article{Gilpin2014Enhanced-Lung-E,
	Abstract = {Background: Whole-lung scaffolds can be created by perfusion decellularization of cadaveric donor lungs. The resulting matrices can then be recellularized to regenerate functional organs. This study evaluated the capacity of acellular lung scaffolds to support recellularization with lung progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Methods: Whole rat and human lungs were decellularized by constant-pressure perfusion with 0.1{\{}{\%}{\}} sodium dodecyl sulfate solution. Resulting lung scaffolds were cryosectioned into slices or left intact. Human iPSCs were differentiated to definitive endoderm, anteriorized to a foregut fate, and then ventralized to a population expressing NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1). Cells were seeded onto slices and whole lungs, which were maintained under constant perfusion biomimetic culture. Lineage specification was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining. Regenerated left lungs were transplanted in an orthotopic position. Results: Activin-A treatment, followed by transforming growth factor-$\beta$ inhibition, induced differentiation of{\{}{\~{}}{\}}human iPSCs to anterior foregut endoderm as confirmed by forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), SRY (Sex Determining Region Y)-Box 17 (SOX17), and SOX2 expression. Cells cultured on decellularized lung slices demonstrated proliferation and lineage commitment after{\{}{\~{}}{\}}5 days. Cells expressing Nkx2.1 were identified at 40{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\~{}}{\}}to 60{\{}{\%}{\}} efficiency. Within whole-lung scaffolds and{\{}{\~{}}{\}}under perfusion culture, cells further upregulated Nkx2.1 expression. After orthotopic transplantation, grafts were perfused and ventilated by host vasculature and airways. Conclusions: Decellularized lung matrix supports the culture and lineage commitment of human iPSC-derived lung progenitor cells. Whole-organ scaffolds and biomimetic culture enable coseeding of iPSC-derived endothelial and epithelial progenitors and enhance early lung fate. Orthotopic transplantation may enable further in{\{}{\~{}}{\}}vivo graft maturation. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

	Abstract = {In this study, collagen-elastin constructs were prepared with the aim of producing a material capable of mimicking the mechanical properties of a single alveolar wall. Collagen has been used in a wide range of tissue engineering applications; however, due to its low mechanical properties its use is limited to non load-bearing applications without further manipulation using methods such as cross-linking or mechanical compression. Here, it was hypothesised that the addition of soluble elastin to a collagen hydrogel could improve its mechanical properties. Hydrogels made from collagen only and collagen plus varying amounts elastin were prepared. Young[U+05F3]s modulus of each membrane was measured using the combination of a non-destructive indentation and a theoretical model previously described. An increase in Young[U+05F3]s modulus was observed with increasing concentration of elastin. The use of non-destructive indentation allowed for online monitoring of the elastic moduli of cell-seeded constructs over 8 days. The addition of lung fibroblasts into the membrane increased the stiffness of the hydrogels further and cell-seeded collagen hydrogels were found to have a stiffness equal to the theoretical value for a single alveolar wall ($\backslash$approx5. kPa). Through provision of some of the native extracellular matrix components of the lung parenchyma these scaffolds may be able to provide an initial building block toward the regeneration of new functional lung tissue. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate the transport properties of the alveolar epithelium, we instilled hetastarch (Het; 6{\{}{\%}{\}}, 10 ml, 1 - 1 x 10(4) kDa) into the trachea of isolated rat lungs and then measured the molecular distribution of Het that entered the lung perfusate from the air space over 6 h. Het transport was driven by either diffusion or an oncotic gradient. Perfusate Het had a unique, bimodal molecular weight distribution, consisting of a narrow low-molecular-weight peak at 10-15 kDa (range, 5-46 kDa) and a broad high-molecular-weight band (range 46-2,000 kDa; highest at 288 kDa). We modeled the low-molecular-weight transport as (passive) restricted diffusion or osmotic flow through a small-pore system and the high-molecular-weight transport as passive transport through a large-pore system. The equivalent small-pore radius was 5.0 nm, with a distribution of 150 pores per alveolus. The equivalent large-pore radius was 17.0 nm, with a distribution of one pore per seven alveoli. The small-pore fluid conductivity (2 x 10(-5) ml. h(-1). cm(-2). mmHg(-1)) was 10-fold larger than that of the large-pore conductivity.},

@article{Svenson2012Dendrimers-in-b,
	Abstract = {The formation of particulate systems with well-defined sizes and shapes is of eminent interest in certain medical applications such as drug delivery, gene transfection, and imaging. The high level of control possible over the architectural design of dendrimers; their size, shape, branching length/density, and their surface functionality, clearly distinguishes these structures as unique and optimum carriers in those applications. The bioactive agents may be encapsulated into the interior of the dendrimers or chemically attached/physically adsorbed onto the dendrimer surface, with the option of tailoring the carrier to the specific needs of the active material and its therapeutic applications. In this regard, the high density of exo-presented surface groups allows attachment of targeting groups or functionality that may modify the solution behavior or toxicity of dendrimers. Quite remarkably, modified dendrimers have been shown to act as nano-drugs against tumors, bacteria, and viruses. Recent successes in simplifying and optimizing the synthesis of dendrimers such as the 'lego' and 'click' approaches, provide a large variety of structures while at the same time reducing the cost of their production. The reflections on biomedical applications of dendrimers given in this review clearly demonstrate the potential of this new fourth major class of polymer architecture and indeed substantiate the high hopes for the future of dendrimers. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2012.},

@article{Zhu2009Particokinetics,
	Abstract = {Exposure to nanoparticles has presented potential risks to human cardiorespiratory systems. Pulmonary retention and extrapulmonary redistribution of inhaled nanoparticles have been considered to be important contributing factors of cardiorespiratory diseases. In the present work, 22-nm (59)Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles (radioactive isotope (59)Fe-labeled ferric oxide nanoparticles) were intratracheally instilled into the male Sprague-Dawley rats at a dose of 4 mg/rat. Extrapulmonary distribution of (59)Fe(2)O(3) in organs and its metabolism in lung, blood, urine, and feces were measured for 50 days of exposure. Phagocytosis and clearance of agglomerated nano-Fe(2)O(3) by monocytes/macrophages were observed by histopathology and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry examination. Our results showed intratracheal-instilled nano-(59)Fe(2)O(3) could pass through the alveolar-capillary barrier into systemic circulation within 10 min that consisted with one-compartment kinetic model. The nano-(59)Fe(2)O(3) in the lung was distributed to organs rich in mononuclear phagocytes, including liver, spleen, kidney and testicle. The plasma elimination half-life of nano-(59)Fe(2)O(3) was 22.8 days and the lung clearance rate was 3.06 microg/day, indicating the systemic accumulation and lung retention had occurred. The deposited nano-Fe(2)O(3) in interstitial lung was probably contributed by the particles escaping from alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and macrophages clearance function overloading. Our results suggest that the effect of Fe(2)O(3) nanoparticles exposure, even at low concentration, should be assessed because of the potential lung and systemic cumulative toxicity of the nanoparticles.},

@article{Bashur2009Effect-of-fiber,
	Abstract = {Effective strategies to guide cell alignment and the deposition of an oriented extracellular matrix are critical for the development of anisotropic engineered tissues suitable for the repair of ligament defects. Electrospinning is a promising means to create meshes that can align adherent cells, but the effect of fiber mesh architecture on differentiation has not been examined closely. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of fiber diameter and the degree of fiber alignment on mesenchymal progenitor cell morphology, proliferation, and ligament gene expression. Specifically, a poly(ester urethane)urea elastomer was electrospun onto rigid supports under conditions designed to independently vary the mean fiber diameter (from 0.28 to 2.3 microm) and the degree of fiber alignment. Bone marrow stromal cells--seeded onto supported meshes--adhered to and proliferated on all surfaces. Cells assumed a more spindle-shaped morphology with increasing fiber diameter and degree of fiber alignment, and oriented parallel to fibers on aligned meshes. Expression of the ligament markers collagen 1alpha1, decorin, and tenomodulin appeared to be sensitive to fiber diameter and greatest on the smallest fibers. Concurrently, expression of the transcription factor scleraxis appeared to decrease with increasing fiber alignment. These results suggest that the formation of a ligament-like tissue on electrospun scaffolds is enhanced when the scaffolds consist of aligned submicron fibers.},

@article{Sundaresan1995Prevalence-and-,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the main cause of late morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. This study was designed to accurately determine the prevalence of this syndrome of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (which is presumed to be due to chronic rejection). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done of 212 consecutive lung transplantations performed at Barnes Hospital between July 1988 and March 1994 to characterize the prevalence and course of BOS. One hundred eighty-seven transplant recipients survived at least 3 months after transplantation, putting them at risk for BOS. Recipients free of BOS (group I) were distinguished from those with BOS (group II) based on the presence of declining spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second persistently less than 80{\{}{\%}{\}} of previous baseline) or histologic obliterative bronchiolitis in group II. RESULTS: There were 110 transplantations in group I (59{\{}{\%}{\}}) and 77 in group II (41{\{}{\%}{\}}). At follow-up, BOS was detected using the following criteria: declining forced expiratory volume in 1 second alone, 40 of 77 (52{\{}{\%}{\}}); positive histologic results alone, 7 of 77 (9.1{\{}{\%}{\}}); and both, 30 of 77 (38.9{\{}{\%}{\}}). Declining spirometry was the most common initial sign of BOS onset (57 of 77, 74{\{}{\%}{\}}). There were no differences between groups with respect to age, sex, indication for transplantation, or type of transplantation performed. The mortality rate was significantly higher with BOS (group II, 22 of 77 [28.6{\{}{\%}{\}}] versus group I, 8 of 110 [7.3{\{}{\%}{\}}]; p = 0.001) and was not related to either the type of transplantation performed or the indication for transplantation. Follow-up of group II (mean 35.1 months; range, 7.1 to 63.7 months) showed a delay until BOS onset (16.1 +/- 1.2 months); when BOS was fatal, death ensued within 11.5 +/- 2.4 months of its onset. Comparison of the first and last quartiles of recipients in this series (QTR1 versus QTR4, 53 patients in each) demonstrated a higher prevalence of BOS in QTR1 (24 with BOS of 43 at risk [55.8{\{}{\%}{\}}] versus QTR4, 5 with BOS of 52 at risk [9.6{\{}{\%}{\}}]; p {\textless} 0.001) and a worse BOS functional score in QTR1 (2.2 +/- 0.2 versus QTR4, 0.8 +/- 0.2; p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is truly a clinical syndrome, not simply a pathologic entity; (2) BOS displays considerable latency in onset and progression; (3) lung transplant recipients must therefore be followed up for a sufficient interval to determine the actual prevalence and mortality rate of BOS; and (4) the prevalence and mortality rates of BOS are higher than previously appreciated, exceeding 50{\{}{\%}{\}} and 40{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Little is known about clearance of ultrafine carbon particles from the different regions of the human lung. These particles may accumulate and present a health hazard because of their high surface area. OBJECTIVES: Technetium Tc 99m ((99m)Tc)-radiolabeled 100-nm-diameter carbon particles were inhaled by healthy nonsmokers, asymptomatic smokers, and by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Using a bolus inhalation technique, particle deposition was targeted either to the airways or to the lung periphery, and retention, clearance, and translocation were measured using retained radiotracer imaging. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In vitro studies revealed that mean leaching of soluble (99m)Tc-radiotracer from the carbon particles was 4.1 (2.6 [SD]) {\{}{\%}{\}} after 24 hours. Cumulative (99m)Tc activity in urine at 24 hours was 1.1 (1.3) {\{}{\%}{\}} of activity deposited in the lungs. In the lung periphery, particle retention was not affected by smoking or pulmonary disease; retention was 96 (3) {\{}{\%}{\}} after 24 hours. The small amount of clearance could be attributed to leaching of the (99m)Tc label, suggesting negligible particle clearance. In healthy nonsmokers, retention of particles targeted to the airways was 89 (6) and 75 (10) {\{}{\%}{\}} after 1.5 and 24 hours, respectively. Radiolabel activity did not accumulate in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of detection of our experimental system, most inhaled ultrafine carbon particles are retained in the lung periphery and in the conducting airways without substantial systemic translocation or accumulation in the liver at 48 hours. Repeated exposure may result in significant pulmonary accumulation of ultrafine particles.},

	Abstract = {Bioengineered vascular grafts provide a promising alternative to autografts for replacing diseased or damaged arteries, but necessitate scaffold designs capable of supporting a confluent endothelium that resists endothelial cell (EC) detachment under fluid flow. To this end, we investigated whether tuning electrospun topography (i.e., fiber diameter and orientation) could impact EC morphology, alignment, and structural protein organization with the goal of forming a confluent and well-adhered endothelium under fluid flow. To test this, a composite polymer blend of poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) and type I collagen was electrospun to form scaffolds with controlled fiber diameters ranging from approximately 100-1,200 nm and with varying degrees of fiber alignment. ECs were seeded onto scaffolds, and cell morphology and degree of alignment were quantified using image analysis of fluorescently stained cells. Our results show that ECs form confluent monolayers on electrospun scaffolds, with cell alignment systematically increasing with a larger degree of fiber orientation. Additionally, cells on aligned electrospun scaffolds display thick F-actin bundles parallel to the direction of fiber alignment and strong VE-cadherin expression at cell-cell junctions. Under fluid flow, ECs on highly aligned scaffolds had greater resistance to detachment compared to cells cultured on randomly oriented and semi-aligned scaffolds. These results indicate that scaffolds with aligned topographies may be useful in forming a confluent endothelium with enhanced EC adhesion for vascular tissue engineering applications.},

	Abstract = {The inability to adequately vascularize tissues invitro or invivo is a major challenge in lung tissue engineering. A method that integrates stem cell research with 3D-scaffold engineering may provide a solution. We have successfully isolated mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by a two-step procedure and fabricated mPSC-compatible gelatin/microbubble-scaffolds using a 2-channel fluid jacket microfluidic device. We then integrated the cells and the scaffold to construct alveoli-like structures. The mPSCs expressed pro-angiogenic factors (e.g., b-FGF and VEGF) and induced angiogenesis invitro in an endothelial cell tube formation assay. In addition, the mPSCs were able to proliferate along the inside of the scaffolds and differentiate into type-II and type-I pneumocytes The mPSC-seeded microbubble-scaffolds showed the potential for blood vessel formation in both a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in experiments for subcutaneous implantation in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Our results demonstrate that lung stem/progenitor cells together with gelatin microbubble-scaffolds promote angiogenesis as well as the differentiation of alveolar pneumocytes, resulting in an alveoli-like structure. These findings may help advance lung tissue engineering. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

One technical challenge that has thus far limited the development of a tissue-engineered liver graft is oxygen and nutrient transport. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to generate transplantable liver grafts using decellularized liver matrix. The decellularization process preserves the structural and functional characteristics of the native microvascular network, allowing efficient recellularization of the liver matrix with adult hepatocytes and subsequent perfusion for in vitro culture. The recellularized graft supports liver-specific function including albumin secretion, urea synthesis and cytochrome P450 expression at comparable levels to normal liver in vitro. The recellularized liver grafts can be transplanted into rats, supporting hepatocyte survival and function with minimal ischemic damage. These results provide a proof of principle for the generation of a transplantable liver graft as a potential treatment for liver disease.},

@article{Gobin2003Val-ala-pro-gly,
	Abstract = {The elastin-derived peptide val-ala-pro-gly (VAPG) may be useful as a biospecific cell adhesion ligand for smooth muscle cells. By grafting the peptide sequence into a hydrogel material, we were able to assess its effects on smooth muscle cell adhesion and spreading. These materials are photopolymerizable hydrogels based on acrylate-terminated derivatives of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Because of their high PEG content, these materials are highly resistant to protein adsorption and cell adhesion. However, PEG diacrylate derivatives can be mixed with adhesive peptide-modified PEG monoacrylate derivatives to facilitate cell adhesion. Following photopolymerization, PEG monoacrylate derivatives are grafted into the hydrogel network formed by the PEG diacrylate. This results in covalent immobilization of adhesive peptides to the hydrogel via a flexible linker chain. The resistance of PEG to protein adsorption makes it an ideal material for this model system since cell-material interactions are limited to biomolecules that are covalently incorporated into the material. In this case we were able to demonstrate that VAPG is specific for adhesion of smooth muscle cells. It also was shown that fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and platelets cannot adhere to VAPG. In addition, not only was smooth muscle cell adhesion dependent on ligand concentration, but also cell spreading increased with increasing ligand concentration.},

ECs make up a minor population of cells in a tissue, but play a major role in tissue homeostasis, as well as in diverse pathologies. To understand the biology of ECs, characterization of this cell population is highly desirable, but requires the availability of purified cells. For this purpose, tissues are mechanically minced and subsequently digested enzymatically with collagenase and dispase. ECs in the resulting single-cell suspension are labeled with Abs against EC surface antigens and separated from the remainder of the cells and debris by capture with magnetic beads or by high-speed cell sorting. Purified ECs are viable and suitable for characterization of diverse cellular properties. This protocol is optimized for human tissues but can also be adapted for use with other species. Depending on the tissue, the procedure can be completed in approximately 6 h.},

	Abstract = {Liver extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, topography and biomechanical properties influence cell-matrix interactions. The ECM presents guiding cues for hepatocyte phenotype maintenance, differentiation and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Current understanding of such cell-guiding cues along with advancement of techniques for scaffold fabrication has led to evolution of matrices for liver tissue culture from simple porous scaffolds to more complex 3D matrices with microarchitecture similar to in vivo. Natural and synthetic polymeric biomaterials fabricated in different topographies and porous matrices have been used for hepatocyte culture. Heterotypic and homotypic cell interactions are necessary for developing an adult liver as well as an artificial liver. A high oxygen demand of hepatocytes as well as graded oxygen distribution in liver is another challenging attribute of the normal liver architecture that further adds to the complexity of engineered substrate design. A balanced interplay of cell-matrix interactions along with cell-cell interactions and adequate supply of oxygen and nutrient determines the success of an engineered substrate for liver cells. Techniques devised to incorporate these features of hepatic function and mimic liver architecture range from maintaining liver cells in mm-sized tailor-made scaffolds to a more bottoms up approach that starts from building the microscopic subunit of the whole tissue. In this review, we discuss briefly various biomaterials used for liver tissue engineering with respect to design parameters such as scaffold composition and chemistry, biomechanical properties, topography, cell-cell interactions and oxygenation.},

	Abstract = {The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is mediated in part by inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), which promote degradation of articular cartilage and prevent human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) chondrogenesis. In this study, we combined gene therapy and functional tissue engineering to develop engineered cartilage with immunomodulatory properties that allow chondrogenesis in the presence of pathologic levels of IL-1 by inducing overexpression of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in MSCs via scaffold-mediated lentiviral gene delivery. A doxycycline-inducible vector was used to transduce MSCs in monolayer or within 3D woven PCL scaffolds to enable tunable IL-1Ra production. In the presence of IL-1, IL-1Ra-expressing engineered cartilage produced cartilage-specific extracellular matrix, while resisting IL-1-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and maintaining mechanical properties similar to native articular cartilage. The ability of functional engineered cartilage to deliver tunable anti-inflammatory cytokines to the joint may enhance the long-term success of therapies for cartilage injuries or osteoarthritis. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Orthotopic liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment for end stage liver failure and the shortage of donor organs severely limits the number of patients receiving transplants. Liver tissue engineering aims to address the donor liver shortage by creating functional tissue constructs to replace a damaged or failing liver. Despite decades of work, various bottoms-up, synthetic biomaterials approaches have failed to produce a functional construct suitable for transplantation. Recently, a new strategy has emerged using whole organ scaffolds as a vehicle for tissue engineering. This technique involves preparation of these organ scaffolds via perfusion decellularization with the resulting scaffold retaining the circulatory network of the native organ. This important phenomenon allows for the construct to be repopulated with cells and to be connected to the blood torrent upon transplantation. This opinion paper presents the current advances and discusses the challenges of creating fully functional transplantable liver grafts with this whole liver engineering approach.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\backslash$leq 2.0 {\{}{\AA}{\}} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\{}{\%}{\}} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\{}{\%}{\}} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\{}{\%}{\}} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	Abstract = {Lung bioengineering based on decellularized organ scaffolds is a potential alternative for transplantation. Freezing/thawing, a usual procedure in organ decellularization and storage could modify the mechanical properties of the lung scaffold and reduce the performance of the bioengineered lung when subjected to the physiological inflation-deflation breathing cycles. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of repeated freezing/thawing on the mechanical properties of decellularized lungs in the physiological pressure-volume regime associated with normal ventilation. Fifteen mice lungs (C57BL/6) were decellularized using a conventional protocol not involving organ freezing and based on sodium dodecyl sulfate detergent. Subsequently, the mechanical properties of the acellular lungs were measured before and after subjecting them to three consecutive cycles of freezing/thawing. The resistance (RL ) and elastance (EL ) of the decellularized lungs were computed by linear regression fitting of the recorded signals (tracheal pressure, flow, and volume) during mechanical ventilation. RL was not significantly modified by freezing-thawing: from 0.88 $\backslash$pm 0.37 to 0.90 $\backslash$pm 0.38 cmH2 O$\backslash$cdots$\backslash$cdotmL(-1) (mean $\backslash$pm SE). EL slightly increased from 64.4 $\backslash$pm 11.1 to 73.0 $\backslash$pm 16.3 cmH2 O$\backslash$cdotmL(-1) after the three freeze-thaw cycles (p = 0.0013). In conclusion, the freezing/thawing process that is commonly used for both organ decellularization and storage induces only minor changes in the ventilation mechanical properties of the organ scaffold.},

	Abstract = {Porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) of Cook Biotech is licensed and widely used for tissue remodeling in humans. SIS was shown to be highly effective as an adjuvant in model studies with prostate and ovarian cancer vaccines. However, SIS adjuvanticity relative to alum, another important human-licensed adjuvant, has not yet been delineated in terms of activation of innate immunity via inflammasomes and boosting of antibody responses to soluble proteins and hapten-protein conjugates. We used ovalbumin, and a hapten-protein conjugate, phthalate-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The evaluation of SIS was conducted in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice using both intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes. Inflammatory responses were studied by microarray profiling of chemokines and cytokines and by qPCR of inflammasomes-related genes. Results showed that SIS affected cytokine and chemokines microenvironments such as up-regulation of IL-4 and CD30-ligand and activation of chemotactic factors LIX and KC (neutrophil chemotactic factors), MCP-1 (monocytes chemotactic factors), MIP 1-$\alpha$ (macrophage chemotactic factor) and lymphotactin, as well as, growth factors like M-CSF. SIS also promoted gene expression of Nod-like receptors (NLR) and associated downstream effectors. However, in contrast to alum, SIS had no effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$) or NLRP3, but it appeared to promote both Th1 and Th2 responses under different conditions. Lastly, it was as effective as alum in engendering a lasting and specific antibody response, primarily of IgG1 type.},

	Abstract = {Although the pulmonary epithelia seem to be naturally permeable to a variety of peptides and proteins, the mechanisms of absorption are poorly understood. Possible mechanisms of absorption include: transcytosis; paracellular absorption between two cells; paracellular absorption at the tricellular junction at the intersection of three cells; and absorption through epithelial defects caused by senescent (apoptopic) cells. Evidence to support the role of any of these mechanisms in the absorption of a specific therapeutic by the healthy lung is weak. An emerging hypothesis is that for small peptides (i.e., {\textless}40 kDa) paracellular transport may dominate, while for larger proteins (i.e., {\textgreater}40 kDa) transcytosis may be more important. There is some evidence for receptor-mediated transcytosis of albumin. Complicating factors include osmolality, lung volume, smoking and disease states, macromolecule properties and regional differences.},

	Abstract = {A number of different processing techniques have been developed to design and fabricate three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. The imperfection of the current techniques has encouraged the use of a rapid prototyping technology known as fused deposition modeling (FDM). Our results show that FDM allows the design and fabrication of highly reproducible bioresorbable 3D scaffolds with a fully interconnected pore network. The mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of polycaprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 61 +/- 1{\{}{\%}{\}} and two matrix architectures were studied. The honeycomb-like pores had a size falling within the range of 360 x 430 x 620 microm. The scaffolds with a 0/60/120 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1{\{}{\%}{\}} offset yield strength in air of 41.9 +/- 3.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1{\{}{\%}{\}} offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degrees C) of 29.4 +/- 4.0 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. In comparison, the scaffolds with a 0/72/144/36/108 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1{\{}{\%}{\}} offset yield strength in air of 20.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1{\{}{\%}{\}} offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degrees C) of 21.5 +/- 2.9 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the five-angle scaffolds had significantly lower stiffness and 1{\{}{\%}{\}} offset yield strengths under compression loading than those with a three-angle pattern under both testing conditions (p {\textless} or = 0.05). The obtained stress-strain curves for both scaffold architectures demonstrate the typical behavior of a honeycomb structure undergoing deformation. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human fibroblasts and periosteal cells. Light, environmental scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production on the polycaprolactone surface in the 1$\backslash$textsuperscript{\{}st{\}} culturing week. Over a period of 3-4 weeks in a culture, the fully interconnected scaffold architecture was completely 3D-filled by cellular tissue. Our cell culture study shows that fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells can proliferate, differentiate, and produce a cellular tissue in an entirely interconnected 3D polycaprolactone matrix.},

@article{Michael-Foster2002Mucociliary-tra,
	Abstract = {The mucus lining of the respiratory tract originates from products of secretory cells interspersed among mucosal cells or within submucosal glands and protects the underlying mucosa from dehydration. Current understanding is that the lining is a two-fluid model in which the upper layer is a viscoelastic gel (mucus, cross-linked glycoproteins) that overlies a sol layer (serous). Thus mucus propelled by ciliary beating, flows above the sol layer and contains sloughed cells and xenobiotic materials that come into contact with it. Sensory stimuli enhance mucus secretion and cause bronchoconstriction; responses that are usually coupled to cough and two-phase gas-liquid clearance of mucus. Airway clearance can be measured by scintigraphy using insoluble radio-labeled markers deposited by aerosol delivery onto the mucus layer. In a healthy airway, lung inflation/deflation reflexes and perhaps shearing forces at the airway surface during high rates of airflow, stimulate mucociliary clearance. During the early stages of smoke-related airway pathology and mucus hypersecretion, mucus layer transport is delayed, and abnormal clearance predominates in the smaller peripheral airways. If high velocity of expiratory airflow is preserved then even with chronic exposure to respiratory irritants and cigarette smoke, mucus clearance remains effective due to cough and two-phase, gas-liquid interactions. However, in patients with advanced airway obstruction and incapable of generating forceful expiratory flows, cough and shearing are ineffective and mucociliary clearance is disparate with markedly slowed mucus layer transport within central airways. Mucolytic therapy for patients with advanced airway obstruction improves ventilation and reduces the frequency of exacerbation.},

	Abstract = {Nanoparticles (NP), here defined as particles with a diameter smaller then 100 nm, are increasingly used in different applications, including drug carrier systems and to pass organ barriers such as the blood-brain barrier. On the other hand, a large body of know-how is available regarding toxicological effects of nanoparticle (NP) after inhalation. More specifically, a number of effects of inhaled NP are attributed to their (i) direct effects on the central nervous system, (ii) their translocation from the lung into the bloodstream, and (iii) their capacity to invoke inflammatory responses in the lung with subsequent systemic effects. This paper gives a brief review on the toxicology of inhaled NP, including general principles and current paradigms to explain the special case of NP in pulmonary toxicology. Since the evidence for health risks of NP after inhalation has been increasing over the last decade, this paper tries to extrapolate these findings and principles observed in inhalation toxicology into recommendations and methods for testing NP for nanocarrier purposes. A large gap is present between research on NP in inhalation toxicology and in nanoscaled drug carrying. This review recommends a closer interaction between both disciplines to gain insight in the role of NP size and properties and their mechanisms of acute and chronic interaction with biological systems.},

Transfection systems that are performing well in vitro have been reported to have disadvantageous properties such as rapid clearance and short circulation time often resulting in poor transfection efficiency when applied in vivo. Large unilaminary vesicles (LUV) with encapsulated nucleic acids designated stabilized-plasmid-lipo-particle (SPLP) have showed promising results in terms of systemic stability and accumulation in tumor tissue due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). We have developed a simple protocol for the research-scale preparation of SPLPs from commercially available reagents with high amounts of encapsulated plasmid DNA. The SPLPs show properties of promising accumulation in tumor tissue in comparison to other organs when intravenously injected into xenograft tumor-bearing nude mice. Although transcriptionally targeted suicide gene therapy was not achieved, the SPLPs were capable of mediating reporter gene transfection in subcutaneous flank tumors originating from human small cell lung cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Horiguchi2014Pulmonary-admin,
	Abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an intractable pulmonary disease, causes widespread and irreversible alveoli collapse. In search of a treatment target molecule, which is able to regenerate collapsed alveoli, we sought to identify a factor that induces differentiation in human alveolar epithelial stem cells using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), whose alveolar repair capacity has been reported in animal experiments. When human alveolar epithelial stem cells were exposed to ATRA at a concentration of 10$\mu$M for over seven days, approximately 20{\{}{\%}{\}} of the cells differentiated into each of the type-I and type-II alveolar epithelial cells that constitute the alveoli. In a microarray analysis, integrin-$\alpha$1 and integrin-$\beta$3 showed the largest variation in the ATRA-treated group compared with the controls. Furthermore, the effect of the induction of differentiation in human alveolar epithelial stem cells using ATRA was suppressed by approximately one-fourth by siRNA treatments with integrin $\alpha$1 and integrin $\beta$3. These results suggested that integrin $\alpha$1 and $\beta$3 are factors responsible for the induction of differentiation in human alveolar epithelial stem cells. We accordingly investigated whether integrin nanoparticles also had a regenerative effect in vivo. Elastase-induced COPD model mouse was produced, and the alveolar repair effect of pulmonary administration using nanoparticles of integrin protein was evaluated by X-ray CT scanning. Improvement in the CT value in comparison with an untreated group indicated that there was an alveolar repair effect. In this study, it was shown that the differentiation-inducing effect on human alveolar epithelial stem cells by ATRA was induced by increased expression of integrin, and that the induced integrin enhanced phosphorylation signaling of AKT, resulting in inducing differentiations. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that lung administration of nanoparticles with increased solubility and stability of integrin repaired the alveolus of an Elastase-induced COPD model mouse. Those results show that those integrin nanoparticles are effective as novel COPD treatment target compounds.},

	Abstract = {Controlling and guiding cell behavior requires scaffolding materials capable of programming the three-dimensional (3-D) extracellular environment. In this study, we devised a new self-assembling peptide template for synthesizing nanofibrous hydrogels containing cell-responsive ligands. In particular, the insertion of a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) labile hexapeptide into the self-assembling building blocks of arginine-alanine-aspartate-alanine (RADA) was investigated. A series of peptides, varied by the position of the MMP-2 hexapeptide substrate and the length of RADA blocks, were prepared by parallel synthesis. Their self-assembling capabilities were characterized and compared by circular dichroism spectroscopy and dynamical mechanical analysis. Among all the different insertion patterns, the sequence comprising a centrically positioned MMP-2 substrate was flanked with three RADA units on each side self-assembled into a hydrogel matrix, with mechanical properties and nanofiber morphology comparable to the native material built with (RADA)4 alone. Exposure of the new gel to MMP-2 resulted in peptide cleavage, as confirmed by mass spectroscopy, and a decrease in surface hardness, as detected by nanoindentor, indicating that the enzyme mediated degradation was localized to the gel surface. The new design can be used for introducing biological functions into self-assembling peptides to create scaffolding materials with potential applications in areas such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Angiogenesis assays are an important tool for studying both the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the potential development of therapeutic strategies to modulate neovascularisation. In vivo angiogenesis assays are considered to be the most informative of these but are often expensive, time-consuming and require specialist training to perform. In vitro assays tend to be more rapid, less expensive and easier to interpret. In vitro angiogenesis assays operate on the principle that endothelial cells form tubule-like structures when cultured on a supportive matrix. Assays involving a matrix derived from murine tumours, Matrigel (or a growth factor reduced form of this), are now the most common in vitro tubule formation assays. However, another tubule formation assay has recently been developed in which endothelial cells are co-cultured with fibroblasts. Here, we have used quantitative image analysis to compare the morphological features of tubules formed in the Matrigel assay and this new 'Co-culture' assay, with those of capillaries formed in a microvascular bed in vivo. Tubules formed in standard and growth factor reduced Matrigel assays were short and relatively homogeneous, whereas those formed in the Co-culture assay were significantly more heterogeneous, consisting of both short and long interconnecting tubules that more closely resembled capillaries than Matrigel tubules. Moreover, cells on Matrigel, and to a lesser extent growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel, often clumped into large cell aggregates, a feature rarely seen in the Co-culture assay. In addition, we demonstrate that Matrigel stimulates tubule formation by various non-endothelial cell types, suggesting that tubule formation by endothelial cells may not represent true differentiation of this cell type. In summary, the morphology of tubules in the Co-culture assay appears more representative of capillary formation in vivo, than the endothelial cell changes that occur in either form of Matrigel assay.},

However, to date most of the marketed inhalable products are short-acting formulations that require the patient to inhale several times every day, thus reducing patient compliance. Controlled pulmonary drug delivery is a promising system but the formidable airway clearance mechanisms need to be avoided. This review mainly introduces the barriers impeding the development of controlled pulmonary drug delivery and strategies used to overcome them. We believe that large porous particles, swellable microparticles and porous nanoparticle-aggregate-based particles are the most promising carriers to control drug release in the lung.},

	Abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the penetration of substances into the brain. Because many drugs, particularly peptides, therefore can not be delivered to the brain, carrier systems were developed to overcome this problem. In earlier studies we demonstrated central analgesic effects of a peptide, dalargin (dal), after systemic administration when this substance was bound onto the surface of polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles and coated with polysorbate 80 but not when it was given alone. The aim of the present study was to investigate the body distribution of 3H-labelled dal bound to nanoparticles compared to unbound dal after i.v. injection in mice. The radioactivity in several tissues, including the brain, was separated in subcellular preparations and was measured after a single i.v. injection over time. Dal radioactivity level in brain preparations was 3 times higher when the drug was bound to nanoparticles whereas the first pass pathway in liver was reduced. The results support previous data that nanoparticles can be used to transport peptides across the BBB.},

	Abstract = {Conventional airway in vitro models focus upon the function of individual structural cells cultured in a two-dimensional monolayer, with limited three-dimensional (3D) models of the bronchial mucosa. Electrospinning offers an attractive method to produce defined, porous 3D matrices for cell culture. To investigate the effects of fibre diameter on airway epithelial and fibroblast cell growth and functionality, we manipulated the concentration and deposition rate of the non-degradable polymer polyethylene terephthalate to create fibres with diameters ranging from nanometre to micrometre. The nanofibre scaffold closely resembles the basement membrane of the bronchiole mucosal layer, and epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface on this scaffold showed polarized differentiation. The microfibre scaffold mimics the porous sub-mucosal layer of the airway into which lung fibroblast cells showed good penetration. Using these defined electrospinning parameters we created a biphasic scaffold with 3D topography tailored for optimal growth of both cell types. Epithelial and fibroblast cells were co-cultured onto the apical nanofibre phase and the basal microfibre phase respectively, with enhanced epithelial barrier formation observed upon co-culture. This biphasic scaffold provides a novel 3D in vitro platform optimized to mimic the different microenvironments the cells encounter in vivo on which to investigate key airway structural cell interactions in airway diseases such as asthma.},

Recent advances in this field include the incorporation of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix proteins into three-dimensional (3D) models to recapitulate the structure, organization and functionality of live tissue in situ. Cells within such a 3D environment behave very differently from cells on two-dimensional (2D) substrates, as cell-matrix interactions trigger signalling pathways and cellular responses in 3D, which may not be observed in 2D. Thus, the use of 3D systems can be advantageous for the assessment of disease progression over 2D set-ups alone. Here, we highlight the current advantages and challenges of employing 3D systems in the study of cancer and provide an overview to guide the appropriate use of distinct models in cancer research.},

The peak levels in all organs with the exception of tumor and spleen were reached within 24 h. The highest levels were found in the organs of the reticuloendothelial system, liver, spleen, and lungs. The radioactivity in the other organs was found to be low, approximately 2{\{}{\%}{\}}. In the tumor and the spleen the highest levels of radioactivity were found at approximately 7 d. At this stage the level of radioactivity in the tumor was 40 times higher than that in muscle. However, the amount of isotope detected in the tumor was still generally less than 1{\{}{\%}{\}} of the injected dose. The concentration of radioactivity in the tumor was found to be quite variable. Higher levels of radioactivity were correlated with a low amount of tumor necrosis indicating the importance of viable tumor tissue for the accumulation of the radiolabel in this particular animal model.},

Many design parameters, such as the binder solution properties, have yet to be optimized to ensure maximal biocompatibility and osteoconductivity with sufficient mechanical properties. This study tailored the phosphoric acid-based binder solution concentration to 8.75 wt{\{}{\%}{\}} to maximize cytocompatibility and mechanical strength, with a supplementation of Tween 80 to improve printing. To further enhance the formulation, collagen was dissolved into the binder solution to fabricate collagen-calcium phosphate composites. Reducing the viscosity and surface tension through a physiologic heat treatment and Tween 80, respectively, enabled reliable thermal inkjet printing of the collagen solutions. Supplementing the binder solution with 1-2 wt{\{}{\%}{\}} collagen significantly improved maximum flexural strength and cell viability. To assess the bone healing performance, we implanted 3D printed scaffolds into a critically sized murine femoral defect for 9 weeks. The implants were confirmed to be osteoconductive, with new bone growth incorporating the degrading scaffold materials. In conclusion, this study demonstrates optimization of material parameters for 3D printed calcium phosphate scaffolds and enhancement of material properties by volumetric collagen incorporation via inkjet printing.},

	Abstract = {It is known that there is a correlation between a cell membrane potential and the proliferation of the cell. The high proliferation capacity of liver cells can also be attributed to its specific cell membrane potential as liver cell is recognized as one of the most depolarized of all differentiated cells. We hypothesized that this phenomenon can be emphasized by growing liver cells in conducting scaffolds that can increase the electrical communication among the cells. In this article, using tissue engineering techniques, we grew hepatocyte cells in scaffolds with various compositions. It was found that the scaffolds containing conducting polymer of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) provide the best condition for attachment and proliferation of the cells. More specifically, the blend of hyaluronan, PEDOT, and collagen (I) as dopants in gelatin--chitosan-based scaffold presented the best cell/scaffold interactions for regeneration of liver cells. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Malda201325backslashtext,
	Abstract = {With advances in tissue engineering, the possibility of regenerating injured tissue or failing organs has become a realistic prospect for the first time in medical history. Tissue engineering - the combination of bioactive materials with cells to generate engineered constructs that functionally replace lost and/or damaged tissue - is a major strategy to achieve this goal. One facet of tissue engineering is biofabrication, where three-dimensional tissue-like structures composed of biomaterials and cells in a single manufacturing procedure are generated. Cell-laden hydrogels are commonly used in biofabrication and are termed "bioinks". Hydrogels are particularly attractive for biofabrication as they recapitulate several features of the natural extracellular matrix and allow cell encapsulation in a highly hydrated mechanically supportive three-dimensional environment. Additionally, they allow for efficient and homogeneous cell seeding, can provide biologically-relevant chemical and physical signals, and can be formed in various shapes and biomechanical characteristics. However, despite the progress made in modifying hydrogels for enhanced bioactivation, cell survival and tissue formation, little attention has so far been paid to optimize hydrogels for the physico-chemical demands of the biofabrication process. The resulting lack of hydrogel bioinks have been identified as one major hurdle for a more rapid progress of the field. In this review we summarize and focus on the deposition process, the parameters and demands of hydrogels in biofabrication, with special attention to robotic dispensing as an approach that generates constructs of clinically relevant dimensions. We aim to highlight this current lack of effectual hydrogels within biofabrication and initiate new ideas and developments in the design and tailoring of hydrogels. The successful development of a "printable" hydrogel that supports cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation will significantly advance this exciting and promising approach for tissue engineering.},

	Abstract = {This study summarizes the development and testing of a scaffold to promote engraftment of cells in the distal lung. A fibrinogen-fibronectin-vitronectin hydrogel (FFVH) was developed and optimized with respect to its mechanical and biological properties for this application. In vitro, FFVH scaffolds promoted attachment, histiotypic growth and expression of basement membrane proteins by primary ovine lung mesenchymal cells derived from lung biopsies. In vivo testing was then performed to assess the ability of FFVHs to promote cell engraftment in the sheep lung. Treatment with autologous cells delivered using FFVH was clinically well tolerated. Cells labelled with a fluorescent dye (PKH-26) were detected at treatment sites after 1 month. Tissue mass (assessed by CT imaging) and lung perfusion (assessed by nuclear scintigraphy) were increased at emphysema test sites. Post-treatment histology demonstrated cell proliferation and increased elastin expression without scarring or collapse. No treatment-related pathology was observed at healthy control sites. FFVH scaffolds promote cell attachment, spreading and extracellular matrix expression in vitro and apparent engraftment in vivo, with evidence of trophic effects on the surrounding tissue. Scaffolds of this type may contribute to the development of cell-based therapies for patients with end-stage pulmonary diseases.},

	Abstract = {Lung transplantation is a therapeutic option for patients with end-stage pulmonary disorders. Unfortunately, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), most commonly manifest as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), continues to be highly prevalent and is the major limitation to long-term survival. The pathogenesis of BOS is complex and involves alloimmune and nonalloimmune pathways. Clinically, BOS manifests as airway obstruction and dyspnea that are classically progressive and ultimately fatal; however, the course is highly variable, and distinguishable phenotypes may exist. There are few controlled studies assessing treatment efficacy, but only a minority of patients respond to current treatment modalities. Ultimately, preventive strategies may prove more effective at prolonging survival after lung transplantation, but their remains considerable debate and little data regarding the best strategies to prevent BOS. A better understanding of the risk factors and their relationship to the pathological mechanisms of chronic lung allograft rejection should lead to better pharmacological targets to prevent or treat this syndrome.},

The presence of a sol-gel precursor in the sheath liquid was necessary for the formation of stable, coaxial jets and hollow fibers with robust walls.

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is a rapid prototyping technique that can create complex 3D structures by inkjet printing of a liquid binder onto powder biomaterials for tissue engineering scaffolds. Direct fabrication of scaffolds from 3DP, however, imposes a limitation on material choices by manufacturing processes. In this study, we report an indirect 3DP approach wherein a positive replica of desired shapes was printed using gelatin particles, and the final scaffold was directly produced from the printed mold. To create patient-specific scaffolds that match precisely to a patient's external contours, we integrated our indirect 3DP technique with imaging technologies and successfully created custom scaffolds mimicking human mandibular condyle using polycaprolactone and chitosan for potential osteochondral tissue engineering. To test the ability of the technique to precisely control the internal morphology of the scaffolds, we created orthogonal interconnected channels within the scaffolds using computer-aided-design models. Because very few biomaterials are truly osteoinductive, we modified inert 3D printed materials with bioactive apatite coating. The feasibility of these scaffolds to support cell growth was investigated using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). The BMSCs showed good viability in the scaffolds, and the apatite coating further enhanced cellular spreading and proliferation. This technique may be valuable for complex scaffold fabrication.},

It is common to control phenotypes of ES cells with varying molecular compounds; however, there is still a need to improve the controllability of cell differentiation, and thus, the quality of created tissue. This study demonstrates a simple but effective strategy to promote formation of vascularized cardiac muscle-like tissue in EBs and form contracting cardiovascular organoids by modulating the stiffness of a cell adherent hydrogel. Using collagen-conjugated polyacrylamide hydrogels with controlled elastic moduli, we discovered that cellular organization in a form of vascularized cardiac muscle sheet was maximal on the gel with the stiffness similar to cardiac muscle. We envisage that the results of this study will greatly contribute to better understanding of emergent behavior of stem cells in developmental and regeneration process and will also expedite translation of EB studies to drug-screening device assembly and clinical treatments.},

	Abstract = {Composites of cationized gelatin microspheres (CGMS), crosslinked with either 3 mM or 6 mM glutaraldehyde solution, and a novel hydrogel material, oligo(poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate) (OPF) were fabricated and investigated toward prolonging the release of plasmid DNA in vivo relative to the constituent materials. The composites and constituent materials were investigated in a subcutaneous murine model to assess the release of 125I-labeled plasmid DNA and 125I-labeled cationized gelatin in vivo. The time profiles of the radioactivity remaining were employed to compare the profiles of DNA release and cationized gelatin degradation. Both composite formulations (incorporating either 3 mM or 6 mM CGMS) prolonged the bioavailability of plasmid DNA relative to both injected plasmid DNA solution and the respective non-embedded cationized gelatin microspheres. Injected plasmid DNA solution persisted in the subject for only 7-10 days, whereas the persistence of DNA from composites of OPF and either 3 mM or 6 mM CGMS extended to at least day 42. The 3 mM and 6 mM CGMS each increased the persistence of DNA slightly, relative to injection of DNA solution, to between 28 and 35 days. Interestingly, the release profile of plasmid DNA from composites was not significantly different from the release of DNA from OPF alone. The release of plasmid DNA from the composites was in accord with the degradation of the microspheres within the OPF. These results show that composites of OPF and cationized gelatin microspheres are able to prolong the availability of plasmid DNA in vivo relative to cationized gelatin microspheres alone and provide a promising candidate material for the sustained, controlled release of plasmid DNA. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Colloidal drug delivery systems have been extensively investigated as drug carriers for the application of different drugs via different routes of administration. Systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes, have been investigated for a long time for the treatment of various lung diseases. The pulmonary route, owing to a noninvasive method of drug administration, for both local and systemic delivery of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) forms an ideal environment for $\backslash$r$\backslash$nAPIs acting on pulmonary diseases and disorders. Additionally, this route offers many advantages, such as a high surface area with rapid absorption due to high vascularization and circumvention of the first pass effect. Aerosolization or inhalation of colloidal systems is currently being extensively studied and has huge potential for targeted drug delivery in the treatment of various diseases. Furthermore, the surfactant-associated proteins present at the interface enhance the effect of these formulations by decreasing the surface tension and allowing the maximum effect. The most challenging part of developing a colloidal system $\backslash$r$\backslash$nfor nebulization is to maintain the critical physicochemical parameters for successful inhalation. The following review focuses on the current status of different colloidal systems available for the treatment of various lung disorders along with their characterization. Additionally, different in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo cell models developed for the testing of these systems with studies involving cell culture analysis are also discussed.},

@article{Kloxin2012Responsive-cult,
	Abstract = {We describe the development of a well-based cell culture platform that enables experimenters to control the geometry and connectivity of cellular microenvironments spatiotemporally. The base material is a hydrogel comprised of photolabile and enzyme-labile crosslinks and pendant cell adhesion sequences, enabling spatially-specific, in situ patterning with light and cell-dictated microenvironment remodeling through enzyme secretion. Arrays of culture wells of varying shape and size were patterned into the hydrogel surface using photolithography, where well depth was correlated with irradiation dose. The geometry of these devices can be subsequently modified through sequential patterning, while simultaneously monitoring changes in cell geometry and connectivity. Towards establishing the utility of these devices for dynamic evaluation of the influence of physical cues on tissue morphogenesis, the effect of well shape on lung epithelial cell differentiation (i.e., primary mouse alveolar type II cells, ATII cells) was assessed. Shapes inspired by alveoli were degraded into hydrogel surfaces. ATII cells were seeded within the well-based arrays and encapsulated by the addition of a top hydrogel layer. Cell differentiation in response to these geometries was characterized over 7 days of culture with immunocytochemistry (surfactant protein C, ATII; T1$\alpha$ protein, alveolar type I (ATI) differentiated epithelial cells) and confocal image analysis. Individual cell clusters were further connected by eroding channels between wells during culture via controlled two-photon irradiation. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the development and utility of responsive hydrogel culture devices to study how a range of microenvironment geometries of evolving shape and connectivity might influence or direct cell function.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluates the feasibility of poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) as a tracheal replacement. To improve biocompatibility, the lumen was modified by gelatin hydrogel crosslinked with two different reagents, EDC and genipin. It was found that the choice of crosslinking agents could significantly affect human lung carcinoma cell proliferation. Genipin-crosslinked gelatin hydrogel had significantly better cell proliferation than EDC-crosslinked hydrogel. The study further investigated the performance of the PCL tube modified by genipin-crosslinked gelatin, using a rabbit tracheal implantation model with implants harvested and histologically examined. In vivo results showed that the PCL tube possessed suitable mechanical properties for resisting collapse during implantation. Additionally, PCL modified by genipin-crosslinked gelatin was found to suppress granulation tissue growth and prolong animal survival time in comparison with the original PCL tube. Genipin could be an effective treatment to reduce granulation tissue formation at the tracheal anastomoses. Copyright {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2010 John Wiley {\{}{\&}{\}} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Lau2013Hepatogenesis-o,
	Abstract = {The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has raised hopes in circumventing the current limitations in cell-based therapies where autologous stem cells could be generated from terminally differentiated somatic cells. Given the relatively short history of iPSC research, most of the studies are scientific exploratory in nature and hence have minimal practical usage. In this study, we aimed to combine existing knowledge on iPSC differentiation with three-dimensional (3D) scaffold platform so as to fabricate implantable constructs for liver regeneration. A micro-cavitary hydrogel (MCG) platform was employed as a continuous system for both colonies and/or EBs formation and differentiation. The advantage of MCG system is that it further enhances nutrient exchange and also permits greater living space for the encapsulated pluripotent stem cells to rapidly grow into colonies and/or EBs compared to typical non-MCG system. Murine iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were encapsulated respectively in alginate MCG system and after culturing for 10 days; colonies/EBs were formed spontaneously. Differentiation conditions were then introduced to direct the cells toward endodermal lineage and subsequently hepatic lineage and maturation. Up-regulation of endoderm markers and hepatic markers was observed in both iPSCs and ESCs suggesting that iPSC as effectively as the ESCs in MCG system. Urea and albumin production were significantly higher compared to monolayer culture, demonstrating the beneficial effects of MCG system. The results from this work provide foundation in understanding of iPSC differentiation in 3D engineered environment and aid in future biomedical research of iPSC technology. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both the inherent and modifiable properties of polymeric micelles make them particularly well suited for drug delivery purposes. An emphasis of this review has been placed on both the description and characterization techniques of the physical properties of polymeric micelles. Relevant properties discussed include micellar association, morphology, size and stability. These properties and characterization techniques are included to provide context for the known advantages and applications of polymeric micelles for drug delivery. The advantages and applications discussed include solubilization of poorly soluble molecules, sustained release and size advantages, and protection of encapsulated substances from degradation and metabolism. The three most widely studied block copolymer classes are characterized by their hydrophobic blocks, and are poly(propylene oxide), poly(L-amino acid)s and poly(ester)s. These three classes of block copolymers are reviewed with multiple examples of current research in which formulation techniques with polymeric micelles have been applied to some of the most challenging molecules in the pharmaceutical industry. The polymeric micelles used for drug delivery in these examples have shown the abilities to attenuate toxicities, enhance delivery to desired biological sites and improve the therapeutic efficacy of active pharmaceutical ingredients.},

	Abstract = {Type II cells are the defenders of the alveolus. They produce surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse, they actively transport water to prevent filling of the air sacs that would otherwise prevent gas exchange, and they differentiate to type I epithelial cells. They are an indispensable component of functional lung tissue. To understand the functionality of type II cells in isolation, we sought to track their fate in decellularized matrices and to assess their ability to contribute to barrier function by differentiation to type I alveolar epithelial cells. Rat type II cells were isolated from neonatal rat lungs by labeling with the RTII-70 surface marker and separation using a magnetic column. This produced a population of {\~{}}50{\{}{\%}{\}} RTII-70-positive cells accompanied by few type I epithelial cells or $\alpha$-actin-positive mesenchymal cells. This population was seeded into decellularized rat lung matrices and cultured for 1 or 7 days. Culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium +10{\{}{\%}{\}} fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in reduced expression of epithelial markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. By 7 days, no epithelial markers were visible by immunostaining; nearly all cells were $\alpha$-actin positive. Gene expression for the mesenchymal markers, $\alpha$-actin, vimentin, and TGF-$\beta$R, was significantly upregulated on day 1 (p=0.0005, 0.0005, and 2.342E-5, respectively). Transcript levels of $\alpha$-actin and TGF-$\beta$R remained high at 7 days (p=1.364E-10 and 0.0002). Interestingly, human type II cells cultured under the same conditions showed a similar trend in the loss of epithelial markers, but did not display high expression of mesenchymal markers. Rat cells additionally showed the ability to produce and degrade the basement membrane and extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin, collagen IV, and collagen I. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed significant increases in expression of the fibronectin and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) genes after 1 day in culture (p=0.0135 and 0.0128, respectively) and elevated collagen I expression at 7 days (p=0.0016). These data suggest that the original type II-enriched population underwent a transition to increased expression of mesenchymal markers, perhaps as part of a survival or wound-healing program. These results suggest that additional medium components and/or the application of physiologically appropriate stimuli such as ventilation may be required to promote lung-specific epithelial phenotypes.},

@article{Garg2012Scaffold:-A-Nov,
	Abstract = {Scaffolds are implants or injects, which are used to deliver cells, drugs, and genes into the body. Different forms of polymeric scaffolds for cell/drug delivery are avail- able: (1) a typical three-dimensional porous matrix, (2) a nanofibrous matrix, (3) a thermosen- sitive sol-gel transition hydrogel, and (4) a porous microsphere. A scaffold provides a suitable substrate for cell attachment, cell proliferation, differentiated function, and cell migration. Scaffold matrices can be used to achieve drug delivery with high loading and efficiency to specific sites. Biomaterials used for fabrication of scaffold may be natural polymers such as alginate, proteins, collagens, gelatin, fibrins, and albumin, or synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyglycolide. Bioceramics such as hydroxyapatites and tricalcium phosphates also are used. Techniques used for fabrication of a scaffold include particulate leaching, freeze-drying, supercritical fluid technology, thermally induced phase separation, rapid prototyping, powder compaction, sol-gel, and melt moulding. These techniques allow the preparation of porous structures with regular porosity. Scaffold are used successfully in various fields of tissue engineering such as bone formation, periodontal regeneration, repair of nasal and auricular malformations, cartilage development, as artificial corneas, as heart valves, in tendon repair ,in ligament replacement, and in tumors. They also are used in joint pain inflammation, diabetes, heart disease, osteochondrogenesis, and wound dressings. Their application of late has extended to delivery of drugs and genetic materials, including plasmid DNA, at a controlled rate over a long period of time. In addition, the incorporation of drugs (i.e., inflammatory inhibitors and/or antibiotics) into scaffolds may be used to prevent infec- tion after surgery and other disease for longer duration. Scaffold also can be used to provide adequate signals (e.g., through the use of adhesion peptides and growth factors) to the cells, to induce and maintain them in their desired differentiation stage, and to maintain their survival and growth. The present review gives a detailed account of the need for the development of scaffolds along with the materials used and techniques adopted to manufacture scaffolds for tissue engineering and for prolonged drug delivery.},

	Abstract = {Two different protein nanoparticles that are totally different in shape and surface structure, i.e. Escherichia coli DNA-binding protein (eDPS) (spherical, 10{\{}{\~{}}{\}}nm) and Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome (tPTS) (cylindrical, 12{\{}{\~{}}{\}}$\backslash$times{\{}{\~{}}{\}}15{\{}{\~{}}{\}}nm) were engineered for in{\{}{\~{}}{\}}vivo optical tumor detection: arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide (CDCRGDCFC) was genetically inserted to the surface of each protein nanoparticle, and also near-infrared fluorescence dye was chemically linked to the surface lysine residues. The specific affinity of RGD for integrin ($\alpha$v$\beta$3) facilitated the uptake of RGD-presenting protein nanoparticles by integrin-expressing tumor cells, and also the protein nanoparticles neither adversely affected cell viability nor induced cell damage. After intravenously injected to tumor-bearing mice, all the protein nanoparticles successfully reached tumor with negligible renal clearance, and then the surface RGD peptides caused more prolonged retention of protein nanoparticles in tumor and accordingly higher fluorescence intensity of tumor image. In particular, the fluorescence of tumor image was more intensive with tPTS than eDPS, which is due presumably to longer in{\{}{\~{}}{\}}vivo half-life and circulation of tPTS that originates from thermophilic and acidophilic bacterium. Although eDPS and tPTS were used as proof-of-concept in this study, it seems that other protein nanoparticles with different size, shape, and surface structure can be applied to effective in{\{}{\~{}}{\}}vivo tumor detection.},

@article{Potkay2014The-promise-of-,
	Abstract = {Microfluidic or microchannel artificial lungs promise to enable a new class of truly portable, therapeutic artificial lungs through feature sizes and blood channel designs that closely mimic those found in their natural counterpart. These new artificial lungs could potentially: 1) have surface areas and priming volumes that are a fraction of current technologies thereby decreasing device size and reducing the foreign body response; 2) contain blood flow networks in which cells and platelets experience pressures, shear stresses, and branching angles that copy those in the human lung thereby improving biocompatibility; 3) operate efficiently with room air, eliminating the need for gas cylinders and complications associated with hyperoxemia; 4) exhibit biomimetic hydraulic resistances, enabling operation with natural pressures and eliminating the need for blood pumps; and, 5) provide increased gas exchange capacity enabling respiratory support for active patients. This manuscript reviews recent research efforts in microfluidic artificial lungs targeted at achieving the advantages above, investigates the ultimate performance and scaling limits of these devices using a proven mathematical model, and discusses the future challenges that must be overcome in order for microfluidic artificial lungs to be applied in the clinic. If all of these promising advantages are realized and the remaining challenges are met, microfluidic artificial lungs could revolutionize the field of pulmonary rehabilitation.},

@article{Hennink2012Novel-crosslink,
	Abstract = {Hydrogels are presently under investigation as matrices for the controlled release of bioactive molecules, in particular pharmaceutical proteins, and for the encapsulation of living cells. For these applications, it is often required that the gels degrade under physiological conditions. This means that the originally three-dimensional structure has to disintegrate preferably in harmless products to ensure a good biocompatibility of the hydrogel. In this overview, different chemical and physical crosslinking methods used for the design of biodegradable hydrogels are summarized and discussed. Chemical crosslinking is a highly versatile method to create hydrogels with good mechanical stability. However, the crosslinking agents used are often toxic compounds, which have been extracted from the gels before they can be applied. Moreover, crosslinking agents can give unwanted reactions with the bioactive substances present in the hydrogel matrix. Such adverse effects are avoided with the use of physically crosslinked gels. ?? 2012.},

@article{De-Paepe2011Alveolar-epithe,
	Abstract = {The role of umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived stem cell therapy in neonatal lung injury remains undetermined. We investigated the capacity of human CB-derived CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells to regenerate injured alveolar epithelium in newborn mice. Double-transgenic mice with doxycycline (Dox)-dependent lung-specific Fas ligand (FasL) overexpression, treated with Dox between embryonal day 15 and postnatal day 3, served as a model of neonatal lung injury. Single-transgenic non-Dox-responsive littermates were controls. CD34(+) cells (1 $\backslash$times 10(5) to 5 $\backslash$times 10(5)) were administered at postnatal day 5 by intranasal inoculation. Engraftment, respiratory epithelial differentiation, proliferation, and cell fusion were studied at 8 weeks after inoculation. Engrafted cells were readily detected in all recipients and showed a higher incidence of surfactant immunoreactivity and proliferative activity in FasL-overexpressing animals compared with non-FasL-injured littermates. Cord blood-derived cells surrounding surfactant-immunoreactive type II-like cells frequently showed a transitional phenotype between type II and type I cells and/or type I cell-specific podoplanin immunoreactivity. Lack of nuclear colocalization of human and murine genomic material suggested the absence of fusion. In conclusion, human CB-derived CD34(+) cells are capable of long-term pulmonary engraftment, replication, clonal expansion, and reconstitution of injured respiratory epithelium by fusion-independent mechanisms. Cord blood-derived surfactant-positive epithelial cells appear to act as progenitors of the distal respiratory unit, analogous to resident type II cells. Graft proliferation and alveolar epithelial differentiation are promoted by lung injury.},

@article{Cone2009Barrier-propert,
	Abstract = {Mucus is tenacious. It sticks to most particles, preventing their penetration to the epithelial surface. Multiple low-affinity hydrophobic interactions play a major role in these adhesive interactions. Mucus gel is also shear-thinning, making it an excellent lubricant that ensures an unstirred layer of mucus remains adherent to the epithelial surface. Thus nanoparticles (NP) must diffuse readily through the unstirred adherent layer if they are to contact epithelial cells efficiently. This article reviews some of the physiological and biochemical properties that form the mucus barrier. Capsid viruses can diffuse through mucus as rapidly as through water and thereby penetrate to the epithelium even though they have to diffuse 'upstream' through mucus that is being continuously secreted. These viruses are smaller than the mucus mesh spacing, and have surfaces that do not stick to mucus. They form a useful model for developing NP for mucosal drug delivery. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The development of new inhalation devices for asthma drugs raises the issue of the relationship between pulmonary deposition and therapeutic effect of inhaled drugs in patients with obstructive lung diseases. We thus conducted a randomized, double-blind and double-dummy, four-period crossover study in 13 patients with moderate asthma (mean age 36 yr; FEV1 59{\{}{\%}{\}} of predicted), who inhaled 0.25 and 0.5 mg terbutaline sulphate on separate occasions either via a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) or Turbuhaler{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}} (TBH). Pulmonary deposition was 8.1 $\backslash$pm 2.7{\{}{\%}{\}} and 8.3 $\backslash$pm 2.3{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively, of the nominal dose for pMDI and 19.0 $\backslash$pm 7.3{\{}{\%}{\}}, and 22.0 $\backslash$pm 8.1{\{}{\%}{\}} for TBH. The FEV1 increase after 0.25 mg terbutaline sulphate via TBH was significantly greater than after 0.25 mg via pMDI. No significant differences in FEV1 increase were observed between 0.25 mg via TBH, 0.5 mg via pMDI, or 0.5 mg via TBH. Other lung function variables showed similar dose- and device-related changes. We concluded that: (1) the dose of terbutaline sulphate deposited in the lungs is dependent on which inhalation system is used; (2) TBH delivers about twice the amount of drug to the lungs as the pMDI; and (3) the observed difference in deposition is reflected in the bronchodilating effect.},

This result indicates that the elastic modulus of this class of hydrogels can be tuned by the ionic strength in a highly predictable manner. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies reveal that higher ionic strength leads to thinner but more rigid peptide fibers that are packed more densely. The self-diffusion coefficient of small molecules inside the hydrogel decrease linearly with its ionic strength, but this decrease is mainly a salt effect rather than diffusion barriers imposed by the hydrogel matrix.},

@article{Smadja-Lamere2008JNK-mediated-ph,
	Abstract = {The adenovirus type 2 Early Region 4 ORF4 (E4orf4) protein induces a caspase-independent death program in tumor cells involving changes in actin dynamics that are functionally linked to cell killing. Because an increase in myosin II-based contractility is needed for the death of E4orf4-expressing cells, we have proposed that alteration of cytoskeletal tension is part of the signals engaging the death pathway. Yet the mechanisms involved are poorly defined. Herein, we show that the Jun N-terminal kinase JNK is activated in part through a pathway involving Src, Rho, and ROCK (Rho kinase) and contributes to dysregulate adhesion dynamics and to kill cells in response to E4orf4. JNK supports the formation of atypically robust focal adhesions, which are bound to the assembly of the peculiar actomyosin network typifying E4orf4-induced cell death and which are required for driving nuclear condensation. Remarkably, the dramatic enlargement of focal adhesions, actin remodeling, and cell death all rely on paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-178, which is induced by E4orf4 in a JNK-dependent way. Furthermore, we found that Ser-178-paxillin phosphorylation is necessary to decrease adhesion turnover and to enhance the time residency of paxillin at focal adhesions, promoting its recruitment from an internal pool. Our results indicate that perturbation of tensional homeostasis by E4orf4 involves JNK-regulated changes in paxillin adhesion dynamics that are required to engage the death pathway. Moreover, our findings support a role for JNK-mediated paxillin phosphorylation in adhesion growth and stabilization during tension signaling.},

	Abstract = {Peripheral nerve regeneration can be enhanced by the stimulation of formation of bands of B{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}ngner prior to implantation. Aligned electrospun poly([epsilon]-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers were fabricated to test their potential to provide contact guidance to human Schwann cells. After 7 days of culture, cell cytoskeleton and nuclei were observed to align and elongate along the fiber axes, emulating the structure of bands of B{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}ngner. Microarray analysis revealed a general down-regulation in expression of neurotrophin and neurotrophic receptors in aligned cells as compared to cells seeded on two-dimensional PCL film. Real-time-PCR analyses confirmed the up-regulation of early myelination marker, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and the down-regulation of NCAM-1, a marker of immature Schwann cells. Similar gene expression changes were also observed on cells cultured on randomly oriented PCL electrospun fibers. However, up-regulation of the myelin-specific gene, P0, was observed only on aligned electrospun fibers, suggesting the propensity of aligned fibers in promoting Schwann cell maturation.},

	Abstract = {The alveolar epithelium of the lung is by far the most permeable epithelial barrier of the human body. The risk for adverse effects by inhaled nanoparticles (NPs) depends on their hazard (negative action on cells and organism) and on exposure (concentration in the inhaled air and pattern of deposition in the lung). With the development of advanced in vitro models, not only in vivo, but also cellular studies can be used for toxicological testing. Advanced in vitro studies use combinations of cells cultured in the air-liquid interface. These cultures are useful for particle uptake and mechanistic studies. Whole-body, nose-only, and lung-only exposures of animals could help to determine retention of NPs in the body. Both approaches also have their limitations; cellular studies cannot mimic the entire organism and data obtained by inhalation exposure of rodents have limitations due to differences in the respiratory system from that of humans. Simulation programs for lung deposition in humans could help to determine the relevance of the biological findings. Combination of biological data generated in different biological models and in silico modeling appears suitable for a realistic estimation of potential risks by inhalation exposure to NPs.},

Male BALB/c mice received a single dose of 0.8$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}mg $\backslash$cdot kg(-1) AuNPs (40$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}nm) by oropharyngeal aspiration 24 hours after priming with LPS (0.4$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}mg $\backslash$cdot kg(-1)) through the same route. Metal contents were analyzed in different organs by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Oropharyngeal aspiration resulted in high metal concentrations in lungs (P {\textless} 0.001); however, these were much lower after pretreatment with LPS (P {\textless} 0.05). Significantly higher concentrations of Au were detected in heart and thymus of healthy animals, whereas higher concentrations of Au NPs were observed in spleen in LPS-primed animals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The distribution of AuNPs from lungs to secondary target organs depends upon the health status, indicating that targeting of distinct secondary organs in nanomedicine needs to be considered carefully under health and inflammatory conditions.},

	Abstract = {Background Nebulized particles must have diameters between 1 to 5 $\mu$m (optimal particle size range [OPSR]) to be deposited in the lower respiratory tract. The purpose of this study is to determine factors that affect the particle size distributions of nebulized albuterol. Methods We used a sophisticated laser diffraction machine to measure aerosol particle size distributions. We compared the percentage of particles in the OPSR at different flow rates through single-use disposable (SUD) and semipermanent nebulizers at different flow rates under different conditions. Results The SUD nebulizer produced OPSR percentages of 16{\{}{\%}{\}}, 28{\{}{\%}{\}}, 40{\{}{\%}{\}}, 50{\{}{\%}{\}}, 56{\{}{\%}{\}}, and 62{\{}{\%}{\}} at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 Liters per minute (Lpm), respectively. The semipermanent nebulizer, however, produced OPSR percentages of 57{\{}{\%}{\}}, 57{\{}{\%}{\}}, 60{\{}{\%}{\}}, and 64{\{}{\%}{\}} at 3, 4, 5, and 6 Lpm, respectively. The home pump produced a gas flow rate of 5.2 Lpm through the SUD nebulizer and 4.2 Lpm through the semipermanent nebulizer. Single-use disposable nebulizer performance did not degrade with use up to 150 nebulizations. Optimal particle size range percentages did not change significantly with large or small nebulization volumes. Conclusion Single-use disposable nebulizers do not degrade with use, but their performance is highly dependent on gas flow rates. At the flow rate achieved by the home pump, the semipermanent nebulizer performs better than the SUD nebulizer. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Johnson2011Tailoring-mater,
	Abstract = {In the native tissue, the interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, mechanical stability, and signaling. It has been shown that decellularized ECMs can be processed into injectable formulations, thereby allowing for minimally invasive delivery. Upon injection and increase in temperature, these materials self-assemble into porous gels forming a complex network of fibers with nanoscale structure. In this study we aimed to examine and tailor the material properties of a self-assembling ECM hydrogel derived from porcine myocardial tissue, which was developed as a tissue specific injectable scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering. The impact of gelation parameters on ECM hydrogels has not previously been explored. We examined how modulating pH, temperature, ionic strength, and concentration affected the nanoscale architecture, mechanical properties, and gelation kinetics. These material characteristics were assessed using scanning electron microscopy, rheometry, and spectrophotometry, respectively. Since the main component of the myocardial matrix is collagen, many similarities between the ECM hydrogel and collagen gels were observed in terms of the nanofibrous structure and modulation of properties by altering ionic strength. However, variation from collagen gels was noted for the gelation temperature along with varied times and rates of gelation. These discrepancies when compared to collagen are likely due to the presence of other ECM components in the decellularized ECM based hydrogel. These results demonstrate how the material properties of ECM hydrogels could be tailored for future in vitro and in vivo applications.},

	Abstract = {Plastically compressed dense collagen (DC) gels mimic the microstructural, mechanical, and biological properties of native osteoid. This study investigated the effect of hybridizing DC with osteoinductive nano-sized bioactive glass (nBG) particles in order to potentially produce readily implantable, and mineralizable, cell seeded hydrogel scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Due to the high surface area of nBG and increased reactivity, calcium phosphate formation was immediately detected within as processed DC-nGB hybrid gel scaffolds. By day 3 in simulated body fluid, accelerated mineralization was confirmed through the homogeneous growth of carbonated hydroxylapatite on the nanofibrillar collagen framework. At day 7, there was a 13 fold increase in the hybrid gel scaffold compressive modulus. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts, three-dimensionally seeded at the point of nanocomposite self-assembly, were viable up to day 28 in culture. In the absence of osteogenic supplements, MC3T3-E1 metabolic activity and alkaline phosphatase production were affected by the presence of nBG, indicating accelerated osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, no cell-induced contraction of DC-nBG gel scaffolds was detected. The accelerated mineralization of rapidly produced DC-nBG hybrid gels indicates their potential suitability as osteoinductive cell delivery scaffolds for bone regenerative therapy.},

@article{Poole2006Role-of-mucolyt,
	Abstract = {There is, to date, no medical therapy that modifies the decline in lung function that occurs in COPD. As the disease becomes more severe, exacerbations of COPD become increasingly common, affecting patient quality of life and increasing health care costs. Mucolytic agents, through their actions on inflammatory and oxidative pathways, have potential benefits in COPD. This paper reviews the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the effectiveness of at least 2 months of daily therapy with oral mucolytics in COPD. Based on evidence from 26 RCTs, mucolytics reduce exacerbations by up to 0.8 exacerbations per year, with a greater effect in patients with more severe COPD. This effect appears to be of a similar magnitude to the reduction in exacerbations seen with tiotropium and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), but RCTs that compared the agents would be required to confirm this. Mucolytics do not affect the rate of lung function decline, but they do not have any significant adverse effects. Mucolytic treatment should be considered in: patients with more severe COPD who have frequent or prolonged exacerbations; those who are repeatedly admitted to hospital; or in those patients with frequent exacerbations who are unable to take tiotropium or ICS.},

@article{Yeh2011Mechanism-and-c,
	Abstract = {In order to increase the absorption of hydrophilic macromolecules in the small intestine, permeation enhancers such as chitosan (CS) and its derivatives have been evaluated. The aim of the current work was to investigate, on molecular levels, the effect of CS on tight junction (TJ) integrity in Caco-2 cells. The observed changes in transepithelial-electrical-resistance measurements and the staining patterns of the monolayer Caco-2 cells demonstrate that CS can transiently and reversibly open the TJs between cells, thus enhancing the paracellular permeability. TJ ultra-structures examined by transmission electron microscopy support the concept that CS did induce transient opening of TJs. We then assessed TJ disruption at the gene and protein expression levels. Our data indicate that exposure to CS followed by recovery resulted in a significant increase in claudin-4 (Cldn4) gene transcription. Additionally, CS treatment induced redistribution of the TJ protein CLDN4 intracellularly following by its degradation in lysosomes, which represented an important contributing factor in TJ weakening, leading to the opening of TJs. The recovery of TJ after CS disruption required CLDN4 protein synthesis. These results suggest that CS regulates TJs by inducing changes in transmembrane CLDN4 protein. Understanding the mechanism of interaction between CS and epithelial cells is of paramount importance and needs to be established to aid further development in the use of CS to mediate the trans-epithelial drug delivery. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Schleh2013Biodistribution,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pulmonary route is very promising for drug delivery by inhalation. In this regard, nanoparticulate drug delivery systems are discussed, and one very promising nano carrier example is gold nanoparticles (Au NP). Directly after their deposition, inhaled Au NP come into contact with pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D). SP-D can agglomerate Au NP in vitro, and this may influence the clearance as well as the systemic translocation in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clearance and translocation of Au NP at a very early time point after inhalation, as well as the influence of SP-D. METHODS: Aerosolized 20-nm radioactively labeled Au NP were inhaled by healthy adult female mice. One group of mice received dissolved 10 mug of SP-D by intratracheal instillation prior to the Au NP inhalation. After a 2-hr Au NP inhalation period, the mice were killed immediately, and the clearance and translocation to the blood stream were investigated. RESULTS: The highest amount of Au NP was associated with the lung tissue. In the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), more Au NP remained free compared with the amount associated with the BALF cells. The amount of Au NP cleared by the mucociliary escalator was low, probably because of this very early time point. Instillation of SP-D prior to Au NP inhalation had no statistically significant effect on the biodistribution of the Au NP. CONCLUSION: Our data show that inhaled Au NP are retained in the mouse lungs and are translocated after a short time, and that SP-D has only a minor effect on Au NP translocation and clearance at a very early time point.},

@article{Snyder1991Acute-lung-inju,
	Abstract = {In patients dying with acute lung injury, interstitial mesenchymal cells migrate into the airspace where they replicate and deposit connective tissue. We therefore hypothesized that peptides capable of promoting mesenchymal cell migration and replication would be present in the alveolar airspace. To examine this hypothesis, patients with severe acute diffuse lung injury (n = 26) underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Acutely ill patients without lung injury served as controls (n = 12). Recovered effluent was examined for mesenchymal cell growth-promoting and migration-promoting activity. Lavage cell supernates from both patients and controls were devoid of bioactivity. However, substantial growth-promoting and migration-promoting activity was present in lavage fluid from nearly every patient, whereas little or none was present in fluid from controls. Characterization of the bioactivity indicated a significant proportion consisted of three peptides related to PDGF: (a) a 14-kD peptide that shared with PDGF several biophysical, biochemical, receptor-binding, and antigenic properties; (b) a 29-kD peptide that appeared identical to PDGF of platelet origin; and (c) a 38-kD peptide that was biophysically and antigenically similar to PDGF. These data indicate that peptide moieties are present in the airspace of patients after acute lung injury that can signal mesenchymal cell migration and replication.},

@article{Lee2014Highly-moldable,
	Abstract = {The development of three-dimensional polymeric systems capable of mimicking the extracellular matrix is critical for advancing tissue engineering. To achieve these objectives, three-dimensional fibrous scaffolds with "clay"-like properties were successfully developed by coaxially electrospinning polystyrene (PS) and poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) and selective leaching. As PS is known to be nonbiodegradable and vulnerable to mechanical stress, PS layers present at the outer surface were removed using a "selective leaching" process. The fibrous PCL scaffolds that remained after the leaching step exhibited highly advantageous characteristics as a tissue engineering scaffold, including moldability (i.e., clay-like), flexibility, and three-dimensional structure (i.e., cotton-like). More so, the "clay-like" PCL fibrous scaffolds could be shaped into any desired form, and the microenvironment within the clay scaffolds was highly favorable for cell expansion both in vitro and in vivo. These "electrospun-clay" scaffolds overcome the current limitations of conventional electrospun, sheet-like scaffolds, which are structurally inflexible. Therefore, this work extends the scope of electrospun fibrous scaffolds toward a variety of tissue engineering applications.},

	Abstract = {Growth factor signaling plays an essential role in regulating processes such as tissue development, maintenance, and repair. Gene expression levels, diffusion, degradation, and sequestration by extracellular matrix components all play a role in regulating the concentration of growth factors within the cellular microenvironment. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of hydrogel microspheres that mimic the ability of the native extracellular matrix to reversibly bind vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) out of solution. A peptide ligand derived from the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was covalently incorporated into the hydrogel microspheres in order to achieve binding affinity and specificity. In addition to being able to both bind and release VEGF in a controllable manner, the microspheres were also shown to affect human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation. The resulting microspheres may enable new strategies to specifically upregulate or downregulate growth factor signaling in the cellular microenvironment. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The nanostructured fiber and particle morphologies produced by these techniques offer tunable release kinetics applicable to diverse biomedical applications. Coaxial electrospinning/electrospraying, a relatively new technique of fabricating core-shell fibers/particles have added to the versatility of these DDS by affording a near zero-order drug release kinetics, dampening of burst release, and applicability to a wider range of bioactive agents. Controllable electrospinning/spraying of fibers and particles and subsequent drug release from these chiefly polymeric vehicles depends on well-defined solution and process parameters. The additional drug delivery capability from electrospun fibers can further enhance the material's functionality in tissue engineering applications.

@article{Newman1981Deposition-of-p,
	Abstract = {Only a small fraction of the dose from a pressurized aerosol inhaler reaches the lung, because most is deposited on the upper airways by inertial impaction. We have investigated the effects on aerosol deposition of two spacer devices (a 10-cm tube and a 22-cm cone) by incorporating teflon particles (mass median aerodynamic diameter, 3.2 micrometer) labeled with 99mTc into pressurized canisters. Ten subjects with obstructive airway disease inhaled the aerosol in a controlled manner from a conventional actuator alone or in combination with the tube or the cone. Radioaerosol distribution was measured using a shadowshield whole body counter. Deposition on the conducting airways was significantly improved by both spacers, but alveolar deposition was unchanged. Initial oropharyngeal deposition was reduced by both spacers in all 10 patients. We conclude that the spacer devices may have a role to play in aerosol therapy by increasing drug availability to the lung, while at the same time decreasing unwanted drug deposition in the oropharynx.},

@article{Finch2006Keratinocyte-gr,
	Abstract = {Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a locally acting epithelial mitogen that is produced by cells of mesenchymal origin and has an important role in protecting and repairing epithelial tissues. Use of recombinant human KGF (palifermin) in patients with hematologic malignancies reduces the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis experienced after intensive chemoradiotherapy. These results suggest that KGF may be useful in the treatment of patients with other kinds of tumors, including those of epithelial origin. However, its application in this context raises issues that were not pertinent to its use in hematologic cancer because epithelial tumor cells, unlike blood cells, often express the KGF receptor (FGFR2b). Thus, it is important to examine whether KGF could promote the growth of epithelial tumors or protect such tumor cells from the effects of chemotherapy agents. Analyses of KGF and FGFR2b expression in tumor specimens and of KGF activity on transformed cells in vitro and in vivo do not indicate a definitive role for KGF in tumorigenesis. On the contrary, restoring FGFR2b expression to certain malignant cells can induce cell differentiation or apoptosis. However, other observations suggest that, in specific situations, KGF may contribute to epithelial tumorigenesis. Thus, further studies are warranted to examine the nature and extent of KGF involvement in these settings. In addition, clinical trials in patients with solid tumors are underway to assess the potential benefits of using KGF to protect normal tissue from the adverse effects of chemoradiotherapy and its possible impact on clinical outcome.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we report on engineering 3-D pulmonary tissue constructs in vitro. Primary isolates of murine embryonic day 18 fetal pulmonary cells (FPC) were comprised of a mixed population of epithelial, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells as assessed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR of 2-D cultures. The alveolar type II (AE2) cell phenotype in 2-D and 3-D cultures was confirmed by detection of SpC gene expression and presence of the gene product prosurfactant protein C. Three-dimensional constructs of FPC were generated utilizing Matrigel hydrogel and synthetic polymer scaffolds of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and poly-L-lactic-acid (PLLA) fabricated into porous foams and nanofibrous matrices, respectively. Three-dimensional Matrigel constructs contained alveolar forming units (AFU) comprised of cells displaying AE2 cellular ultrastructure while expressing the SpC gene and gene product. The addition of tissue-specific growth factors induced formation of branching, sacculated epithelial structures reminiscent of the distal lung architecture. Importantly, 3-D culture was necessary for inducing expression of the morphogenesis-associated distal epithelial gene fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFr2). PLGA foams and PLLA nanofiber scaffolds facilitated ingrowth of FPC, as evidenced by histology. However, these matrices did not support the survival of distal lung epithelial cells, despite the presence of tissue-specific growth factors. Our results may provide the first step on the long road toward engineering distal pulmonary tissue for augmenting and/or replacing dysfunctional native lung in diseases, such as neonatal pulmonary hypoplasia.},

The most widely used applications of protein CD are to determine whether an expressed, purified protein is folded, or if a mutation affects its conformation or stability. In addition, it can be used to study protein interactions. This protocol details the basic steps of obtaining and interpreting CD data and methods for analyzing spectra to estimate the secondary structural composition of proteins. CD has the advantage that it is that measurements may be made on multiple samples containing 20 $\mu$g or less of proteins in physiological buffers in a few hours. However, it does not give the residue-specific information that can be obtained by X-ray crystallography or NMR.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the respiratory system has an extensive ability to respond to injury and regenerate lost or damaged cells. The unperturbed adult lung is remarkably quiescent, but after insult or injury progenitor populations can be activated or remaining cells can re-enter the cell cycle. Techniques including cell-lineage tracing and transcriptome analysis have provided novel and exciting insights into how the lungs and trachea regenerate in response to injury and have allowed the identification of pathways important in lung development and regeneration. These studies are now informing approaches for modulating the pathways that may promote endogenous regeneration as well as the generation of exogenous lung cell lineages from pluripotent stem cells. The emerging advances, highlighted in this Review, are providing new techniques and assays for basic mechanistic studies as well as generating new model systems for human disease and strategies for cell replacement.},

	Abstract = {Progressive fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in gross alterations in tissue mechanics. Changes in tissue mechanics can further augment scar deposition through fibroblast mechanotransduction. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal form of progressive lung fibrosis, previous work has shown that loss of Thy-1 (CD90) expression in fibroblasts correlates with regions of active fibrogenesis, thus representing a pathologically relevant fibroblast subpopulation. We now show that Thy-1 is a regulator of fibroblast rigidity sensing. Thy-1 physically couples to inactive $\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrins via its RGD-like motif, altering baseline integrin avidity to ECM ligands and also facilitating preadhesion clustering of integrin and membrane rafts via Thy-1's glycophosphatidylinositol tether. Disruption of Thy-1--$\alpha$v$\beta$3 coupling altered recruitment of Src family kinases to adhesion complexes and impaired mechanosensitive, force-induced Rho signaling, and rigidity sensing. Loss of Thy-1 was sufficient to induce myofibroblast differentiation in soft ECMs and may represent a physiological mechanism important in wound healing and fibrosis.},

	Abstract = {The concept of tissue and cell guidance is rapidly evolving as more information regarding the effect of the microenvironment on cellular function and tissue morphogenesis become available. These disclosures have lead to a tremendous advancement in the design of a new generation of multifunctional biomaterials able to mimic the molecular regulatory characteristics and the three-dimensional architecture of the native extracellular matrix. Micro- and nano-structured scaffolds able to sequester and deliver in a highly specific manner biomolecular moieties have already been proved to be effective in bone repairing, in guiding functional angiogenesis and in controlling stem cell differentiation. Although these platforms represent a first attempt to mimic the complex temporal and spatial microenvironment presented in vivo, an increased symbiosis of material engineering, drug delivery technology and cell and molecular biology may ultimately lead to biomaterials that encode the necessary signals to guide and control developmental process in tissue- and organ-specific differentiation and morphogenesis. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Daily doses of theophylline were sufficient to keep serum levels between 55 and 110 mumol/L. The subjects were 26 patients with severe asthma whose symptoms were inadequately controlled by regular treatment with inhaled salbutamol. The severity of BHR improved within 3 wk in the group treated with BDP, whereas no change occurred in the group treated with theophylline. There were no significant changes in FEV1 in either group during the study. When BDP was changed to theophylline there was a deterioration in BHR. Aerosol steroids, rather than theophylline, are the treatment of choice when reduction in the severity of BHR is the aim of treatment in patients with severe asthma.},

	Abstract = {Ultrafine particles ({\textless} 0.10 microm in diameter) are present in great number in polluted urban air, thus posing a potential health risk. In this study, the total deposition fraction (TDF) of ultrafine aerosols with a narrow size distribution (number median diameter NMD = 0.04-0.1 microm and geometric standard deviation sigma(g) = approximately 1.3) was measured in a group of young healthy adults (11 men and 11 women). TDF was obtained with 6 different breathing patterns: tidal volume (V(t)) of 500 ml at respiratory flow rates (Q) of 150 and 250 ml/s; V(t) = 750 ml at Q of 250 and 375 ml/s; and V(t) = 1 L at Q of 250 and 500 ml/s. Aerosols were monitored continuously by a modified condensation nuclei counter while subjects were inhaling them with prescribed breathing patterns. For a given breathing pattern, TDF increased as particle size decreased, regardless of the breathing pattern used. For example, with V(t) = 500 ml and Q = 250 ml/s, TDF (mean +/- SD) was 0.26 +/-.04, 0.30 +/-. 05, 0.35 +/-.05, and 0.44 +/-.07 for NMD = 0.10, 0.08, 0.06, and 0. 04 microm, respectively. For a given NMD, TDF increased with an increase in V(t) and a decrease in Q. TDF was greater for women than men at NMD = 0.04 microm within all breathing patterns used (p {\textless}.05), but the difference was smaller or negligible for larger sized particles. The results suggest that the TDF of ultrafine particles increases with a decrease of particle size and with breathing patterns of longer respiratory time, a pattern that is consistent with diffusion deposition of ultrafine particles. The results also suggest that there is a differential lung dose of ultrafine particles and thus there may be a differential health risk for men versus women.},

Part of this will necessitate large scale production of nanoparticles with new formulations and surface properties to meet novel demands. Our current knowledge of the toxicology of nanoparticles and nanotubes is poor but suggests that nanoparticles may be able to have adverse effects at their portal of entry, for example, the lungs, but that some nanoparticles may also escape the normal defences and translocate from their portal of entry to have diverse effects in other target organs. We suggest that a discipline of nanotoxicology be built up to address the new potential threats that widespread use of new nanoparticles could bring in support of the growth of a safe and sustainable nanotechnology industry.},

@article{Banwell2009Rational-design,
	Abstract = {Biocompatible hydrogels have a wide variety of potential applications in biotechnology and medicine, such as the controlled delivery and release of cells, cosmetics and drugs, and as supports for cell growth and tissue engineering. Rational peptide design and engineering are emerging as promising new routes to such functional biomaterials. Here, we present the first examples of rationally designed and fully characterized self-assembling hydrogels based on standard linear peptides with purely alpha-helical structures, which we call hydrogelating self-assembling fibres (hSAFs). These form spanning networks of alpha-helical fibrils that interact to give self-supporting physical hydrogels of {\textgreater}99{\{}{\%}{\}} water content. The peptide sequences can be engineered to alter the underlying mechanism of gelation and, consequently, the hydrogel properties. Interestingly, for example, those with hydrogen-bonded networks of fibrils melt on heating, whereas those formed through hydrophobic fibril-fibril interactions strengthen when warmed. The hSAFs are dual-peptide systems that gel only on mixing, which gives tight control over assembly. These properties raise possibilities for using the hSAFs as substrates in cell culture. We have tested this in comparison with the widely used Matrigel substrate, and demonstrate that, like Matrigel, hSAFs support both growth and differentiation of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells for sustained periods in culture.},

@article{Unger2005Vascularization,
	Abstract = {Open-cell hollow fibers made of polyethersulfone (PES) manufactured in the absence of solvents with pore diameters smaller than 100 ??m were examined for vascularization by human endothelial cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether the 3-D porous character of the PES surface affected human endothelial cell morphology and functions. Freshly isolated human endothelial cells from the skin (HDMEC), from the lung (HPMEC) and from umbilical cords (HUVEC) and two human endothelial cell lines, HPMEC-ST1.6R and ISO-HAS.c1 were added to PES fibers and cell adherence and growth was followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Prior coating of PES with gelatin or fibronectin was necessary for adhesion and spreading of cells over the uneven porous surface with time. Confluent cells exhibited typical strong PECAM-1 expression at cell-cell borders. Little expression of the activation markers E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 was observed by RT-PCR of endothelial cells growing on PES. However, after stimulation for 4 h by LPS, activation of these markers was observed and it was shown by immunofluorescent staining that induction occurred in most of the cells, thus confirming an intact functionality. Finally, cells growing as a monolayer on PES migrated to form microvessel-like structures when placed under conditions that stimulated angiogenesis. Thus, human endothelial cells grown on fibronectin-coated PES fibers retain important endothelial-cell specific morphological and functional properties and PES may serve as a useful biomaterial in tissue engineering and biotechnology applications. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Vozzi2008Connected-Cultu,
	Abstract = {A multicompartmental bioreactor was conceived and designed to mimic cross talk between cells in different culture chambers connected only by flow, such that cell--cell interaction is mediated by soluble ligands as occurs in the body. The system was tested with a connected culture of murine hepatocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Metabolites such as albumin, urea, lactate and viability were monitored during the course of the experiments and compared with monoculture conditions in the bioreactor. When the two cell types are placed in connected culture, there is an increase in endothelial cell viability and hepatic glucose synthesis as well as albumin and urea production, while overall lactate production in the system is downregulated. The results show that the multicompartmental bioreactor enhances cell function, effectively combining both heterotypic interactions with increased nutrient availability.},

@article{Kubo2012Tissue-engineer,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in stem cell research and tissue engineering have opened new paradigms for future therapies towards many intractable diseases. Many tissue engineering approaches are also applied in the pulmonary research field. Several materials have been utilized as scaffolds to support lung tissue engineering to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the lung. Natural products and synthetic polymers are the two major components of the scaffold materials. Decellularization of allogeneic or xenogenic donor lungs is also utilized to obtain biological 3D matrix scaffolds. Decellularized lungs are recellularized with stem or progenitor cells. Cell sources are the key components for tissue engineering. The best cell source for tissue engineering is autologous cells obtained from patients because it does not induce an immunological response after transplantation. However, the stem/progenitor population in adult organs is generally small, and their capacity for proliferation or differentiation is limited. Knowledge about the endogenous stem/progenitor population in lung tissue has been expanded recently. Although the lung is the most challenging organ for tissue engineering because of its complex 3D structure and more than 40 different cell types, several breakthroughs in respiratory research have been made. These results give us a greater understanding of the possibilities and the limitations of tissue engineering for pulmonary diseases.},

@article{Wang2010Varying-the-dia,
	Abstract = {Aligned, electrospun fibers have shown great promise in facilitating directed neurite outgrowth within cell and animal models. While electrospun fiber diameter does influence cellular behavior, it is not known how aligned, electrospun fiber scaffolds of differing diameter influence neurite outgrowth and Schwann cell (SC) migration. Thus, the goal of this study was to first create highly aligned, electrospun fiber scaffolds of varying diameter and then assess neurite and SC behavior from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants. Three groups of highly aligned, electrospun poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) fibers were created (1325+383 nm, large diameter fibers; 759+179 nm, intermediate diameter fibers; and 293+65 nm, small diameter fibers). Embryonic stage nine (E9) chick DRG were cultured on fiber substrates for 5 days and then the explants were stained against neurofilament and S100. DAPI stain was used to assess SC migration. Neurite length and SC migration distance were determined. In general, the direction of neurite extension and SC migration were guided along the aligned fibers. On the small diameter fiber substrate, the neurite length was 42{\{}{\%}{\}} and 36{\{}{\%}{\}} shorter than those on the intermediate and large fiber substrates, respectively. Interestingly, SC migration did not correlate with that of neurite extension in all situations. SCs migrated equivalently with extending neurites in both the small and large diameter scaffolds, but lagged behind neurites on the intermediate diameter scaffolds. Thus, in some situations, topography alone is sufficient to guide neurites without the leading support of SCs. Scanning electron microscopy images show that neurites cover the fibers and do not reside exclusively between fibers. Further, at the interface between fibers and neurites, filopodial extensions grab and attach to nearby fibers as they extend down the fiber substrate. Overall, the results and observations suggest that fiber diameter is an important parameter to consider when constructing aligned, electrospun fibers for nerve regeneration applications.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT) for the selection of suitable MSCs in cell therapy of an airway allergic animal model. We compared MSCs of BALB/c mice derived from BM and AT with respect to proliferation potential, immunophenotype, and multilineage differentiation capacity. In proliferation potential, MSCs from AT (ASCs) showed higher fibroblastoid colony-forming units frequencies and colony-forming efficiency than MSCs from BM (BMSCs). The flow cytometry analysis showed that both ASCs and BMSCs expressed MSCs-related antigens (CD90 and CD105), whereas they did not express hematopoiesis-related antigens (CD45 and CD11b). There was no significant difference in adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation between the murine ASCs and BMSCs. In conclusion, the present study has shown that ASCs had higher CFU-F frequencies and colony-forming efficiency than BMSCs. ASCs and BMSCs presented a similar surface immunophenotype and multilineage differentiation capacity. Therefore, ASCs in BALB/c mice might be a more useful material for cell therapy of the airway allergic experiment due to the abundance, relatively easy harvesting and high proliferation potential.},

	Abstract = {An RGDSK (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Lys) modified rosette nanotube (RNT) hydrogel composite with unique surface chemistry and favorable cytocompatibility properties for bone repair was developed and investigated. The RNTs are biologically inspired nanomaterials obtained through the self-assembly of a DNA base analog (G???C base) with tailorable chemical functionality and physical properties. In this study, a cell-adhesive RGDSK peptide was covalently attached to the G???C base, assembled into RNTs, and structurally characterized by 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy. Importantly, results showed that the RGDSK modified RNT hydrogels caused around a 200{\{}{\%}{\}} increase in osteoblast (bone-forming cell) adhesion relative to hydrogel controls. In addition, osteoblast proliferation was enhanced on RNT hydrogels compared to hydrogel controls after 3 days, which further confirmed the promising cytocompatibility properties of this scaffold. When analyzing the mechanism of increased osteoblast density on RNT hydrogels, it was found that more fibronectin (a protein which promotes osteoblast adhesion) adsorption occurred on RNT coated hydrogels than uncoated hydrogels. As osteoblast adhesion was greatly enhanced on RNT coated hydrogels compared to poly l-lysine and collagen coated hydrogels, this study indicated that not only the surface chemistry was important in improving osteoblast density (via lysine or RGD groups functionalized on RNTs), but also the biomimetic nanoscale properties of RNTs provided a cell-favorable environment. These results warrant further studies on RNTs in hydrogels for better bone tissue regeneration. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multicomponent, chronic inflammatory disease of the lungs with systemic complications. The majority of the inflammation occurs in the peripheral airways and lung parenchyma. It is a progressive disease, leading to disability and eventual death, despite conventional therapy. Inflammatory activity can be reduced by increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) through inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) IV, the principal PDE isoenzyme within pro-inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and epithelial cells. PDE IV inhibition also has other effects, including relaxation of airway smooth muscle, suppression of smooth muscle mitogenesis and modulation of excitatory activity in pulmonary nerves. Cilomilast is a systemically available, second-generation, selective PDE IV inhibitor. It retains the therapeutic activity of the first-generation PDE IV inhibitors but lacks their profound emetic effect. Cilomilast is the first drug to demonstrate a reduction of tissue cells considered central to the ongoing inflammatory process (macrophages and CD8+ lymphocytes) in patients with stable COPD. Cilomilast is completely absorbed following oral administration and has negligible first-pass metabolism. It exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, with low between-subject variability. Cilomilast is highly protein bound (99.4{\{}{\%}{\}}), but this binding is concentration-independent at clinically relevant doses, and it has a small volume of distribution at steady state (17L). Plasma clearance (approximately 2 L/h) is almost entirely metabolic, through multiple parallel pathways. Its terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 hours and steady state is rapidly achieved with twice-daily administration. The most abundant metabolite, formed by the action of cytochrome P450 2C8, has {\textless}10{\{}{\%}{\}} of the activity of the parent molecule. Cilomilast pharmacokinetics in COPD patients were consistent with those in healthy subjects. Smoking, age and ethnicity had no clinically relevant effects. Total plasma cilomilast pharmacokinetic parameters did not change significantly with renal or hepatic impairment, but concentrations of unbound cilomilast increased with declining renal or hepatic function. Cilomilast had no clinically relevant interactions with a range of drugs likely to be coadministered to patients with COPD, with the exception of erythromycin where concurrent administration with cilomilast was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events, a pharmacodynamic interaction predicted by their secondary pharmacology. Nausea was the principal adverse reaction seen in healthy subjects taking cilomilast, but this was reduced by administration with food or by use of simple dose-escalation regimens. Cilomilast has not shown a propensity for any of the serious cardiac or neurological adverse effects associated with theophylline. Cilomilast exhibits favourable and predictable pharmacokinetics, has few clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and has demonstrated effects on measures of inflammation of potential benefit in the treatment of COPD. It is generally well tolerated and has not generated safety concerns in any clinical study.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of large granulated lactose carrier particle systems on aerosol performance of dry powder inhaler formulations. Granulated lactose carriers with average sizes ranging from 200 to 1,000 $\mu$m were prepared and subsequently fractionated into separate narrow size powders. The fractionated granulated lactose (GL) samples were characterized in terms of size, specific surface area, surface roughness, morphology, density, flowability, and solid-state. The in vitro aerosolization performance was performed on the different size fractions of GL samples from a commercial inhaler device (Aerolizer{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}}) with a model formulation (2{\{}{\%}{\}} w/w salbutamol sulfate). The cascade impaction parameters employed were 60 or 90 L/min with standard (aperture size, 0.6 mm) or modified piercing holes (aperture size, 1.2 mm) of the inhaler loaded capsules. It was shown that the largest size fraction formulation (850--1000 $\mu$m) had a slight improvement in the fine particle fraction (FPF) compared to immediately preceding size fractions, explained by a smaller adhesive force between drug and carrier. Compared to commercial piercing holes, enlarged piercing holes generated a slight decreasing trend of FPF as the lactose powder sizes increased from 200--250 $\mu$m to 600--850 $\mu$m, perhaps due to the reduced detachment force by flow forces. The size, surface roughness, density, and flowability of lactose carrier as well as device design all contributed to the aerosol dispersion performance of granulated lactose-based adhesive mixtures. It was concluded that poorer or enhanced redispersion performance is not an inherent property to the significantly large size of granulated lactose carriers as previously contended.},

	Abstract = {Bioengineered tissue equivalents should provide physiologically relevant biochemical and mechanical cues to support the growth and differentiation of seeded cells. Herein, tubular dense collagen constructs (TDCCs) with collagen content comparable to native extracellular matrix were used to investigate the effect of shear stress alone (i.e. under laminar fluid flow), and shear stress in combination with circumferential strain (i.e. under pulsatile fluid flow) on the proliferation, alignment, and phenotype of three-dimensionally (3D) seeded airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). In addition, the effect of ASMC-mediated remodelling on TDCC matrix morphological and mechanical properties was investigated. Compared to static culture, pulsatile flow increased seeded ASMC growth by 70{\{}{\%}{\}}, improved the homogeneity of cell distribution within the TDCCs and induced differential cellular alignment depending on the primary stimuli. Specifically, within the inner wall, where shear stress is predominant, ASMCs were aligned parallel to fluid flow direction, while within the outer wall ASMCs were aligned parallel to the circumferential strain (perpendicular to fluid flow). In contrast, under laminar flow, ASMCs were aligned parallel to fluid flow direction within both walls. Compared to laminar flow, pulsatile flow resulted in increased positive staining for $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin, and in up-regulated typical ASMC contractile markers suggesting that circumferential strain modulates ASMC differentiation. Pulsatile flow also caused a 60 and 30{\{}{\%}{\}} increase in collagen density within both acellular and cellular TDCCs, respectively, which was reflected in an increased apparent modulus. Compared to static culture, pulsatile stimulation of cellular constructs resulted in 70{\{}{\%}{\}} higher circumferential strength. The TDCCs provide ASMC niche for greater insight into the responses of 3D seeded SMCs to physiologically equivalent in vitro dynamic conditioning.},

	Abstract = {This work was first development of a delivery system capable of maintaining a sustained release of protein drugs at specific sites by using potentially biocompatible porcine articular cartilage. The prepared porcine articular cartilage powder (PCP) was easily soluble in phosphate-buffered saline. The PCP suspension easily entrapped bovine serum albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) in pharmaceutical formulations at room temperature. The aggregation of PCP and BSA-FITC was confirmed by dynamic light scattering. When the BSA-FITC-loaded PCP suspension was subcutaneously injected into rats, it gelled and formed an interconnecting three-dimensional PCP structure that allowed BSA to penetrate through it. The amount of BSA-FITC released from the PCP hydrogel was determined in rat plasma and monitored by real-time in vivo molecular imaging. The data indicated sustained release of BSA-FITC for 20 days in vivo. In addition, the PCP hydrogel induced a slight inflammatory response. In conclusion, we showed that the PCP hydrogel could serve as a minimally invasive therapeutics depot. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Functional behavior of polymeric particles in these fields is strongly influenced by their shape. However, the availability of precisely shaped polymeric particles has been a major bottleneck in understanding and capitalizing on the role of shape in particle function. Here we report a method that directly addresses this need. Our method uses routine laboratory chemicals and equipment to make particles with {\textgreater}20 distinct shapes and characteristic features ranging in size from 60 nm to 30 microm. This method offers independent control over important particle properties such as size and shape, which is crucial to the development of nonspherical particles both as tools and products for a variety of fields.},

@article{Ruan2010Kinetics-of-hyd,
	Abstract = {Taking into account the enzyme inactivation and substrate inhibition, the bioreaction mechanism and kinetics characteristic of egg white protein (EWP) enzymatic hydrolysis by pepsin were investigated. A logarithmic equation h=(1/b) ln (1+abt) indicating the relationship between the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and time was established. For EWP-pepsin system, the reaction mechanism could be deduced from a series of experimental results at different temperatures, pH values, substrate concentrations, and enzyme concentrations. The reaction kinetics and thermodynamic constants (KS=3916.5 g/l, k2=17 202.86 min-1, kd=21 962.03, Ea=56.89 kJ/mol, Ed=51.99 kJ/mol) were responsible for the empirical equations. The results of nonlinear regression of the proposed kinetic model agreed with the experimental data, i.e. the average relative error was less than 5{\{}{\%}{\}}. As a conclusion, the kinetic equations can be used to fit the enzymatic hydrolysis process of egg white protein and to optimise the operating parameters of bioactive peptides preparation for the bioreactor design.},

@article{Seif-Naraghi2012Injectable-extr,
	Abstract = {Injectable hydrogels derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) of decellularized tissues have recently emerged as scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. Here, we introduce the potential for using a decellularized ECM-derived hydrogel for the improved delivery of heparin-binding growth factors. Immobilization of growth factors on a scaffold has been shown to increase their stability and activity. This can be done via chemical crosslinking, covalent bonding, or by incorporating natural or synthetic growth factor-binding domains similar to those found in vivo in sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Many decellularized ECM-derived hydrogels retain native sulfated GAGs, and these materials may therefore provide an excellent delivery platform for heparin-binding growth factors. In this study, the sulfated GAG content of an ECM hydrogel derived from decellularized pericardial ECM was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and its ability to bind basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was established. Delivery in the pericardial matrix hydrogel increased retention of bFGF both in vitro and in vivo in ischemic myocardium compared to delivery in collagen. In a rodent infarct model, intramyocardial injection of bFGF in pericardial matrix enhanced neovascularization by approximately 112{\{}{\%}{\}} compared to delivery in collagen. Importantly, the newly formed vasculature was anastomosed with existing vasculature. Thus, the sulfated GAG content of the decellularized ECM hydrogel provides a platform for incorporation of heparin-binding growth factors for prolonged retention and delivery. ?? 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

@article{Devillard2014Cell-patterning,
	Abstract = {The aim of tissue engineering is to produce functional three-dimensional (3D) tissue substitutes. Regarding native organ and tissue complexity, cell density and cell spatial 3D organization, which influence cell behavior and fate, are key parameters in tissue engineering. Laser-Assisted Bioprinting (LAB) allows one to print cells and liquid materials with a cell- or picoliter-level resolution. Thus, LAB seems to be an emerging and promising technology to fabricate tissue-like structures that have the physiological functionality of their native counterparts. This technology has additional advantages such as automation, reproducibility, and high throughput. It makes LAB compatible with the (industrial) fabrication of 3D constructs of physiologically relevant sizes. Here we present exhaustively the numerous steps that allow printing of viable cells with a well-preserved micrometer pattern. To facilitate the understanding of the whole cell patterning experiment using LAB, it is discussed in two parts: (1) preprocessing: laser set-up, bio-ink cartridge and bio-paper preparation, and pattern design; and (2) processing: bio-ink printing on the bio-paper. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Kreyling2002Translocation-o,
	Abstract = {Recently it was speculated that ultrafine particles may translocate from deposition sites in the lungs to systemic circulation. This could lead to accumulation and potentially adverse reactions in critical organs such as liver, heart, and even brain, consistent with the hypothesis that ultrafine insoluble particles may play a role in the onset of cardiovascular diseases, as growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests. Ultrafine (192)Ir radio-labeled iridium particles (15 and 80 nm count median diameter) generated by spark discharging were inhaled by young adult, healthy, male WKY rats ventilated for 1 h via an endotracheal tube. After exposure, excreta were collected quantitatively. At time points ranging from 6 h to 7 d, rats were sacrificed, and a complete balance of (192)Ir activity retained in the body and cleared by excretion was determined gamma spectroscopically. Thoracic deposition fractions of inhaled 15- and 80-nm (192)Ir particles were 0.49 and 0.28, respectively. Both batches of ultrafine iridium particles proved to be insoluble ({\textless}1{\{}{\%}{\}} in 7 d). During wk 1 after inhalation particles were predominantly cleared via airways into the gastrointestinal tract and feces. This cleared fraction includes particles deposited in the alveolar region. Additionally, minute particle translocation of {\textless}1{\{}{\%}{\}} of the deposited particles into secondary organs such as liver, spleen, heart, and brain was measured after systemic uptake from the lungs. The translocated fraction of the 80-nm particles was about an order of magnitude less than that of 15-nm particles. In additional studies, the biokinetics of ultrafine particles and soluble (192)Ir was studied after administration by either gavage or intratracheal instillation or intravenous injection. They confirmed the low solubility of the particles and proved that (1) particles were neither dissolved nor absorbed from the gut, (2) systemically circulating particles were rapidly and quantitatively accumulated in the liver and spleen and retained there, and (3) soluble (192)Ir instilled in the lungs was rapidly excreted via urine with little retention in the lungs and other organs. This study indicates that only a rather small fraction of ultrafine{\{}{\#}{\}}10; iridium particles has access from peripheral lungs to systemic circulation and extrapulmonary organs. Therefore, the hypothesis that systemic access of ultrafine insoluble particles may generally induce adverse reactions in the cardiovascular system and liver leading to the onset of cardiovascular diseases needs additional detailed and differentiated consideration.},

@article{Jacot2008Substrate-stiff,
	Abstract = {Cardiac cells mature in the first postnatal week, concurrent with altered extracellular mechanical properties. To investigate the effects of extracellular stiffness on cardiomyocyte maturation, we plated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes for 7 days on collagen-coated polyacrylamide gels with varying elastic moduli. Cells on 10 kPa substrates developed aligned sarcomeres, whereas cells on stiffer substrates had unaligned sarcomeres and stress fibers, which are not observed in vivo. We found that cells generated greater mechanical force on gels with stiffness similar to the native myocardium, 10 kPa, than on stiffer or softer substrates. Cardiomyocytes on 10 kPa gels also had the largest calcium transients, sarcoplasmic calcium stores, and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase2a expression, but no difference in contractile protein. We hypothesized that inhibition of stress fiber formation might allow myocyte maturation on stiffer substrates. Treatment of maturing cardiomyocytes with hydroxyfasudil, an inhibitor of RhoA kinase and stress fiber-formation, resulted in enhanced force generation on the stiffest gels. We conclude that extracellular stiffness near that of native myocardium significantly enhances neonatal rat ventricular myocytes maturation. Deviations from ideal stiffness result in lower expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase, less stored calcium, smaller calcium transients, and lower force. On very stiff substrates, this adaptation seems to involve RhoA kinase.},

	Abstract = {Conventional scaffold fabrication techniques result in narrow pore architectures causing a limited interconnectivity and use of porogens, which affects the bio- or cyto-compatibility. To ameliorate this, cryogels are immensely explored due to their macro-porous nature, ease in fabrication, using ice crystals as porogens, the shape property, easy reproducibility and cost-effective fabrication technique. Cryogels in the present study are prepared from nonmulberry Indian muga silk gland protein fibroin of Antheraea assamensis using two different fabrication temperatures (-20 and -80 $\backslash$degC). Anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate is used to solubilize fibroin, which in turn facilitates gelation by accelerating the {\{}{\ss}{\}}-sheet formation. Ethanol is employed to stabilize the 3D network and induces bimodal porosity. The gels thus formed demonstrate increased {\{}{\ss}{\}}-sheet content (FTIR) and a considerable effect of pre-freezing temperatures on 3D micro-architectures. The cryogels are capable of absorbing large amounts of water and withstanding mechanical compression without structure deformation. Further, cell impregnated cryogels well support the viability of human hepatocarcinoma cells (live/dead assay). The formation of cellular aggregates (confocal laser and scanning electron microscope), derivation in metabolic activity and proliferation rate are obtained in constructs fabricated at different temperatures. In summary, the present work reveals promising insights in the development of a biomimetic functional template for biomedical therapeutics and liver tissue engineering.},

	Abstract = {In this article, novel smart hydrogels based on biodegradable pH sensitive poly(L-glutamic acid-g-2-hydroxylethyl methacrylate) (PGH) chains and temperature-sensitive hydroxypropylcellulose-g-acrylic acid (HPC-g-AA) segments were designed and synthesized. The influence of pH and temperature on the equilibrium swelling ratios of the hydrogels was discussed. The optical transmittance of the hydrogels was also changed as a function of temperature, which reflecting that the HPC-g-AA part of the hydrogels became hydrophobic at the temperature above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). At the same time, the LCST of the hydrogels had a visible pH-dependent behavior. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed the morphology of the hydrogels before and after enzymatic degradation. The biodegradation rate of the hydrogels was directly related to the PGH content and the pH value. The in vitro release of bovine serum albumin from the hydrogels were investigated. The release profiles indicated that both the HPC-g-AA and PGH contents played important roles in the drug release behaviors. These results show that the smart hydrogels seem to be of great promise in pH-temperature oral drug delivery systems. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {With the rapidly growing popularity and sophistication of inhalation therapy, there is an increasing demand for tailor-made inhalable drug particles capable of affording the most efficient delivery to the lungs and the most optimal therapeutic outcomes. To cope with this formulation demand, a wide variety of novel particle technologies have emerged over the past decade. The present review is intended to provide a critical account of the current goals and technologies of particle engineering for the development of pulmonary drug delivery systems. These technologies cover traditional micronization and powder blending, controlled solvent crystallization, spray drying, spray freeze drying, particle formation from liquid dispersion systems, supercritical fluid processing and particle coating. The merits and limitations of these technologies are discussed with reference to their applications to specific drug and/or excipient materials. The regulatory requirements applicable to particulate inhalation products are also reviewed briefly.},

@article{Coraux2005Embryonic-stem-,
	Abstract = {Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewable and pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst-stage embryo. ES cell pluripotency is being investigated increasingly to obtain specific cell lineages for therapeutic treatments and tissue engineering. Type II alveolar epithelial cells have been derived from murine ES cells, but the capacity of the latter to generate differentiated airway epithelial tissue has never been reported. Herein, we show by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry that murine ES cells are able to differentiate into nonciliated secretory Clara cells, and that type I collagen induces this commitment. Moreover, when cultured at the air-liquid interface, ES cells give rise to a fully differentiated airway epithelium. By quantitative histologic examination, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy, we show that the bioengineered epithelium is composed of basal, ciliated, intermediate, and Clara cells, similar to those of native tracheobronchial airway epithelium. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting reveal that the generated epithelium also exhibits the ultrastructural features and secretory functions characteristic of airway epithelial tissue. These results open new perspectives for cell therapy of injured epithelium in airway diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiolitis obliterans.},

	Abstract = {Due to the rapid development of the nanotechnology industry in the last decade, nanoparticles (NPs) are omnipresent in our everyday life today. Many nanomaterials have been engineered for medical purposes. These purposes include therapy for pulmonary diseases. On other hand, people are endeavoring to develop nanomaterials for improvement or replacement of traditional therapies. On the other hand, nanoparticles, as foreign material in human bodies, are reported to have potential adverse effects on the lung, including oxidase stress, inflammation, fibrosis and genotoxicity. Further, these damages could induce pulmonary diseases and even injuries in other tissues. It seems that nanoparticles may exert two-sided effects. Toxic effects of nanomaterials should be considered when their use is developed for therapies. Hence this review will attempt to summarize the two-side roles of nanoparticles in both therapies for pulmonary diseases and initiation of lung diseases and even secondary diseases caused by lung injuries. Determinants of these effects such as physicochemical properties of nanoparticles will also be discussed.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in tissue engineering have adapted the additive manufacturing technology, also known as three-dimensional printing, which is used in several industrial applications, for the fabrication of bioscaffolds and viable tissue and/or organs to overcome the limitations of other in vitro conventional methods. 3D bioprinting technology has gained enormous attention as it enabled 3D printing of a multitude of biocompatible materials, different types of cells and other supporting growth factors into complex functional living tissues in a 3D format. A major advantage of this technology is its ability for simultaneously 3D printing various cell types in defined spatial locations, which makes this technology applicable to regenerative medicine to meet the need for suitable for transplantation suitable organs and tissues. 3D bioprinting is yet to successfully overcome the many challenges related to building 3D structures that closely resemble native organs and tissues, which are complex structures with defined microarchitecture and a variety of cell types in a confined area. An integrated approach with a combination of technologies from the fields of engineering, biomaterials science, cell biology, physics, and medicine is required to address these complexities. Meeting this challenge is being made possible by directing the 3D bioprinting to manufacture biomimetic-shaped 3D structures, using organ/tissue images, obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography, and employing computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies. Applications of 3D bioprinting include the generation of multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, heart valves, etc. The current 3D bioprinting technologies need to be improved with respect to the mechanical strength and integrity in the manufactured constructs as the presently used biomaterials are not of optimal viscosity. A better understanding of the tissue/organ microenvironment, which consists of multiple types of cells, is imperative for successful 3D bioprinting.},

	Abstract = {Early neovascularization is important for autologous fat transplant survival. SVF cells are ideal seed cells. Both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and SVF cells can promote neovascularization. However, the half-life (about 50$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}min) of VEGF is too short to sustain an adequate local concentration. We have investigated whether VEGF-polylactic acid (PLA) nano-sustained release microspheres plus SVF cells can improve neovascularization and survival of transplanted fat tissues. SVF cells were harvested and constructed VEGF-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres in vitro. Human fat tissues was mixed with SVF cells plus VEGF-PLA, SVF cells alone or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as the control. These three mixtures were injected into random sites in 18 nude mice. Two months later, the transplants were weighed and examined histologically; and capillaries were counted to quantify neovascularization. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and anti-VEGF stains were applied to reveal cell infiltration. The mean wet weight of fat in the SVF plus VEGF-PLA, SVF alone, and control transplants were 0.18$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}$\backslash$pm$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}0.013$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}g, 0.16$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}$\backslash$pm$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}0.015$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}g, and 0.071$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}$\backslash$pm$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}0.12$\backslash$hspace{\{}0.167em{\}}g, respectively; the differences between groups were statistically significant. More vessels were present in the SVF plus VEGF-PLA transplants than in the other two types. Transplants mixed with SVF cells also had an acceptable density of capillaries. Histological analysis revealed that both the SVF plus VEGF-PLA and SVF alone transplants, but not the control transplants, were composed of adipose tissue, and had less fat necrosis and less fibrosis than control specimens. SVF plus VEGF-PLA transplants had significantly greater capillary density and VEGF expression than the other two transplant groups. Thus transplanted fat tissue survival and quality can be enhanced by the addition of VEGF-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres plus SVF cells.},

	Abstract = {The treatment of large craniomaxillofacial bone defects is clinically challenging due to the limited availability of transplantable autologous bone grafts and the complex geometry of the bones. The ability to regenerate new bone tissuesa that faithfully replicate the anatomy would revolutionize treatment options. Advances in the field of bone tissue engineering over the past few decades offer promising new treatmentz alternatives using biocompatible scaffold materials and autologous cells. This approach combined with recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies may soon allow the generation of large, bioartificial bone grafts with custom, patient-specific architecture. In this study, we utilize a custom-built 3D printer to develop anatomically shaped polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with varying internal porosities. These scaffolds are assessed for their ability to support induction of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to form vasculature and bone, two essential components of functional bone tissue. The development of functional tissues is assessed in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability to print large mandibular and maxillary bone scaffolds that replicate fine details extracted from patient's computed tomography scans. The findings of this study illustrate the capabilities and potential of 3D printed scaffolds to be utilized for engineering autologous, anatomically shaped, vascularized bone grafts.},

	Abstract = {In 2011, the first in-man successful transplantation of a tissue engineered trachea-bronchial graft, using a synthetic POSS-PCU nanocomposite construct seeded with autologous stem cells, was performed. To further improve this technology, we investigated the feasibility of using polymers with a three dimensional structure more closely mimicking the morphology and size scale of native extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers. We therefore investigated the in vitro biocompatibility of electrospun polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PU) scaffolds, and determined the effects on cell attachment by conditioning the fibers with adhesion proteins. Rat mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were seeded on either PET or PU fiber-layered culture plates coated with laminin, collagen I, fibronectin, poly-d-lysine or gelatin. Cell density, proliferation, viability, morphology and mRNA expression were evaluated. MSC cultures on PET and PU resulted in similar cell densities and amounts of proliferating cells, with retained MSC phenotype compared to data obtained from tissue culture plate cultures. Coating the scaffolds with adhesion proteins did not increase cell density or cell proliferation. Our data suggest that both PET and PU mats, matching the dimensions of ECM fibers, are biomimetic scaffolds and, because of their high surface area-to-volume provided by the electrospinning procedure, makes them per se suitable for cell attachment and proliferation without any additional coating. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Charnigo2007Derivatives-of-,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to characterize nanoparticles using derivatives of scattering profiles of evanescent waves/surface plasmons. We start the procedure using the scattering profiles for an unknown configuration of nanoparticles, either from physical experiments or numerical simulations conducted for different nanoparticles on surfaces. We apply the statistical technique of compound estimation to recover the derivatives of scattering profiles. The L(1) discrepancies with the corresponding curves from known configurations are used to identify the most plausible configuration of particles that could yield the "experimental" profiles. We conduct a simulation study to see how often the new procedure correctly recovers the agglomeration level for gold spherical nanoparticles on a thin gold film. The results suggest that first derivatives are much more effective for characterization than undifferentiated profiles and that M(33) is the most useful element for distinguishing among configurations. The proposed compound estimation technique is more effective than typical inverse analyses based on look-up tables and can be used effectively in nanoparticle characterization platforms.},

@article{Buxboim2010How-deeply-cell,
	Abstract = {Tissue cells lack the ability to see or hear but have evolved mechanisms to feel into their surroundings and sense a collective stiffness. A cell can even sense the effective stiffness of rigid objects that are not in direct cellular contact -- like the proverbial princess who feels a pea placed beneath soft mattresses. How deeply a cell feels into a matrix can be measured by assessing cell responses on a controlled series of thin and elastic gels that are affixed to a rigid substrate. Gel elasticity E is readily varied with polymer concentrations of now-standard polyacrylamide hydrogels, but to eliminate wrinkling and detachment of thin gels from an underlying glass coverslip, vinyl groups are bonded to the glass before polymerization. Gel thickness is nominally specified using micron-scale beads that act as spacers, but gels swell after polymerization as measured by z-section, confocal microscopy of fluorescent gels. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure E at gel surfaces, employing stresses and strains that are typically generated by cells and yielding values for E that span a broad range of tissue microenvironments. To illustrate cell sensitivities to a series of thin-to-thick gels, the adhesive spreading of mesenchymal stem cells was measured on gel mimics of a very soft tissue (eg. brain, E {\{}{\~{}}{\}} 1 kPa). Initial results show that cells increasingly respond to the rigidity of an underlying {\{}$\backslash$textquoteleft{\}}hidden{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} surface starting at about 10--20 $\mu$m gel thickness with a characteristic tactile length of less than about 5 $\mu$m.},

@article{Ahmed2013Self-Assembly-o,
	Abstract = {A lysine based peptide amphiphile (PA) is designed and synthesized for efficient water immobilization. The PA with a minimum gelation concentration (MGC) of 1{\{}{\%}{\}} w/v in water shows prolonged stability and can also efficiently immobilize aqueous mixtures of some other organic solvents. The presence of a free amine induced pH dependency of the gelation as the PA could form hydrogel at a pH range of 1-8 but failed to do so above that pH. Various spectroscopic and microscopic experiments such as steady state fluorescence, NMR, IR, CD, and FESEM reveal the presence of hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bond, and $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking interaction in the self-assembly process. The self-aggregation has been correlated with the design of the molecule to show the involvement of supramolecular forces and the hierarchical pathway. While the L analogue formed left-handed helical nanofibers, the other enantiomer showed opposite helicity. Interestingly the equimolar mixture of the isomers failed to form any fibrous aggregate. Although fibers formed at a subgel concentration, no helical nature was observed at this stage. The length and thickness of the fibers increased with increase in the gelator concentration. The nanofibers formed by the gelator are used as a template to prepare mesoporous single wall silica nanotubes (SWSNTs) in situ in plain water without the requirement of any organic solvent as well as any external hydrolyzing agent. The SWSNTs formed are open at both ends, are few micrometers in length, and have an average diameter of {\{}{\~{}}{\}}10 nm. The BET isotherm showed a type IV hysteresis loop suggesting mesoporous nature of the nanotubes.},

Electrospraying is applied in many industrial processes such as painting, microencapsulation, electroemulsification, fine powder production, or micro- and nanothin film deposition prepared from solutions or colloidal suspensions. Recently, the electrospraying entered in microfluidic devices and nanotechnology.

The disease afflicts millions of individuals worldwide, and there are no effective therapeutic approaches. A major reason for this lack of useful treatments is that few of the molecular mechanisms of disease have been defined sufficiently to design appropriate targets for therapy. Our laboratory has focused on the molecular mechanisms through which three selected peptide growth factors could play a role in the development of IPF. Hundreds of growth factors and cytokines could be involved in the complex disease process. We are studying platelet-derived growth factor because it is the most potent mesenchymal cell mitogen yet described, transforming growth factor beta because it is a powerful inducer of extracellular matrix (scar tissue) components by mesenchymal cells, and tumor necrosis factor alpha because it is a pleiotropic cytokine that we and others have shown is essential for the development of IPF in animal models. This review describes some of the evidence from studies in humans, in animal models, and in vitro, that supports the growth factor hypothesis. The use of modern molecular and transgenic technologies could elucidate those targets that will allow effective therapeutic approaches. IMAGES:},

@article{Luo2013Collagen-like-p,
	Abstract = {Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals, and there has been long-standing interest in understanding and controlling collagen assembly in the design of new materials. Collagen-like peptides (CLPs), also known as collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) or collagen-related peptides (CRPs), have thus been widely used to elucidate collagen triple helix structure as well as to produce higher-order structures that mimic natural collagen fibers. This mini-review provides an overview of recent progress on these topics, in three broad topical areas. The first focuses on reported developments in deciphering the chemical basis for collagen triple helix stabilization, which we review not with the intent of describing the basic structure and biological function of collagen, but to summarize different pathways for designing collagen-like peptides with high thermostability. Various approaches for producing higher-order structures via CLP self-assembly, via various types of intermolecular interaction, are then discussed. Finally, recent developments in a new area, the production of polymer-CLP bioconjugates, are summarized. Biological applications of collagen contained hydrogels are also included in this section. The topics may serve as a guide for the design of collagen-like peptides and their bioconjugates for targeted application in the biomedical arena. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhou2014Printability-of,
	Abstract = {In this study, calcium phosphate (CaP) powders were blended with a three-dimensional printing (3DP) calcium sulfate (CaSO4)-based powder and the resulting composite powders were printed with a water-based binder using the 3DP technology. Application of a water-based binder ensured the manufacture of CaP:CaSO4 constructs on a reliable and repeatable basis, without long term damage of the printhead. Printability of CaP:CaSO 4 powders was quantitatively assessed by investigating the key 3DP process parameters, i.e. in-process powder bed packing, drop penetration behavior and the quality of printed solid constructs. Effects of particle size, CaP:CaSO4 ratio and CaP powder type on the 3DP process were considered. The drop penetration technique was used to reliably identify powder formulations that could be potentially used for the application of tissue engineered bone scaffolds using the 3DP technique. Significant improvements (p {\textless} 0.05) in the 3DP process parameters were found for CaP (30-110 ??m):CaSO4 powders compared to CaP ({\textless} 20 ??m):CaSO4 powders. Higher compressive strength was obtained for the powders with the higher CaP:CaSO4 ratio. Hydroxyapatite (HA):CaSO4 powders showed better results than beta-tricalcium phosphate (??-TCP):CaSO 4 powders. Solid and porous constructs were manufactured using the 3DP technique from the optimized CaP:CaSO4 powder formulations. High-quality printed constructs were manufactured, which exhibited appropriate green compressive strength and a high level of printing accuracy. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Zhao2011Active-scaffold,
	Abstract = {Porous biomaterials have been widely used as scaffolds in tissue engineering and cell-based therapies. The release of biological agents from conventional porous scaffolds is typically governed by molecular diffusion, material degradation, and cell migration, which do not allow for dynamic external regulation. We present a new active porous scaffold that can be remotely controlled by a magnetic field to deliver various biological agents on demand. The active porous scaffold, in the form of a macroporous ferrogel, gives a large deformation and volume change of over 70{\{}{\%}{\}} under a moderate magnetic field. The deformation and volume variation allows a new mechanism to trigger and enhance the release of various drugs including mitoxantrone, plasmid DNA, and a chemokine from the scaffold. The porous scaffold can also act as a depot of various cells, whose release can be controlled by external magnetic fields.},
